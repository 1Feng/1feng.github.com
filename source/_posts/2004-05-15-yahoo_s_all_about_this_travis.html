title: Yahoo's all about this Travis
---
<p>
Well, that was pretty nifty.  Launching this site and the announcement that appeared on my <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws/">From the Crossroads</a> blog moved me up in the rankings on the Yahoo! search for "<em>Travis</em>".  Now the only site I have to dethrone is the band <em>Travis</em>.  Watch out <em>Travis</em> the band, I'm coming after you! :)</p>

<p>
P.S.  Yes, it is shameless self (that would be me, <em>Travis</em>) promotion.  I want this site (that would be <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/">Travis Swicegood dot com</a>) in there, too.  So I'm seeing how many times I can legitimately put my name (<em>Travis</em>, that is), in a post.  You see, it would be cheating just to act like a Brady Bunch girl and say Travis, Travis, Travis...  Plus I don't know if the search engines would like that.  Anyhow, this is Travis - Travis Swicegood that is - signing off.</p>

<p>
In case you don't want to count how many times I mention <em>Travis</em> in the above two paragraphs - there are 11 instances of <em>Travis</em>.  And that's not counting the three times <em>Travis</em> is mentioned in this paragraph! ;)</p>

<p>
Ok, so "Hey baby, you should Yahoo! my name.  Yeah, it's #1." isn't going to get me any dates, or at least any dates that I would want, but it's still cool!</p>
