In case you didn't know, I use computers.  A lot.  Between working as a
programmer, writing books, and the occasional leisure time spent playing on
computers, the vast majority of my life is spent with a screen of some sort
in front of it.  That time means I come across and try a lot of different
tools, and some of them actually make my life better.

One such tool I've started using extensively while writing my latest book is
[Notability][].  It's a note taking application that let's  you import PDFs
that you can write directly on top of.  This is important because I can't see
the typos from within my text editor.

Switching environments when switching tasks is an important concept I picked a
while back.  For me, that switching comes when I build the book and switch over
to a PDF version on my iPad to read it.  With Notability, I can take the PDF
version of my book and change rooms or sometimes just turn the chair around
away from the desk, and switch into "editing" mode.

I'm [not alone][] in using an iPad for editing.  I hadn't found an app that
worked well for note taking though, so I often switched back to my text editor
to write notes.  Having to mentally switch context back and forth and back and
forth as I physically switched devices hurt my productivity.  Being able to do
it all in one app has made iPad editing much more feasible.

Once I've finished an edit pass and have a whole slew of changes to make, I
switch back to my computer with my iPad close by.  Notability lets you change
the color of the pen you use, so I swap it out for green, and slightly larger
for impact, then start slashing through all of the red as I mark edits off.
The satisfaction from marking something off with a physical slash can't be
overstated.

I've been using Notability for about a month now and don't know how I managed
to edit without it.  I highly recommend it if you have an iPad and are doing
any type of writing/drafting work.
