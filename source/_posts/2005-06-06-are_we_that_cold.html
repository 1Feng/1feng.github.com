title: Are we that cold?
---
<p>Are we so cold a society that a waitress at a <a href="http://www.documentkc.com/index.php/Ghengis_Khan_Mongolian_Grill">popular restaurant</a> in the urban core is taken back when asked how she's doing?  Seriously, the exchange went like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Her: "How are you today?"<br />
Me: "Fine, and you?"<br />
Her: -still smiling, but with a dumbfounded look - "Uhh... I'm doing good.  Sorry.  Delayed reaction.  I'm not used to people asking me how I'm doing."</p></blockquote>

<p>Is that really the kind of society we want to live in?  Is that the kind <strong>I</strong> want to live in?</p>
