title: BlogKC ? KCPD speeder crackdown
---
<p>
And I saw my first "crackdown" today.  On south 169 heading into Downtown, a KCMO police car came up and tailed a motorcycle who was obviously speeding in the 55 zone (he passed me and I was going 60+) until he hit the 35 zone and busted him.</p>

<p>
Brings up an ethical question.  Is it alright for a cop to observe a "crime" and do nothing about it waiting for a bigger, or in this case more lucrative as far as the department is concerned, crime to be committed?</p>
