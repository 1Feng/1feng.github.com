title: Happy New Year

<p>Happy New Year all.  Spent last night kind of subdued... Was planning on going to the <a href="http://photos.azdailysun.com/images/fb_azds/preview/2/5/9/6/6952.jpg">pine cone drop</a> downtown, but decided against it after an hour an a half battling snow on my bike yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>It was 50 degrees, the roads were pretty well cleaned off, just a bit messy.  I'm planning on snow, but what the hell... I want to end the year the same way I began it - on a mountain bike.  Apparently, 2 or 3 miles east of here got a lot more snow the other day.  There was one point on the <a href="http://aztrail.org/">AZ Trail</a> that no one had been since the snow, and another long stretch where the only other people had been on skis.  It was something else plowing through 10" of snow and sweating because it's so warm out.  Crazy.</p>

<p>Anyhow - here's to another year...</p>
