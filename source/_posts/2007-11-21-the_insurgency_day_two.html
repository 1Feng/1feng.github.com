<p>Grrr...  What started out as just peaceful protests have broken into a full blown insurgency.  With cells going into guerilla mode, it's time to pull out the heavy artillery.  We're not talking nukes yet, but they aren't far behind if this doesn't start feeling better.</p>

<p>Two morning in a row.  Five AM.  Boom.  Awake.  At least this morning it wasn't the sore throat, no today it was only gobs and gobs of gunky snot.  There's not too much I can do really, this is just a standard cold, but still...  grr.</p>
