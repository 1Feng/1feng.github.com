title: MSNBC - Frasier's finale didn't need gimmicks
---
<p>
Looks like I'm through watching TV for awhile now.  With no Friend's, no Fraiser, and all reality TV all hours.  At least now I have an excuse not to watch television.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Quote from MSNBC</legend><br />
And Frasier bade farewell to his radio audience via a Tennyson quote: %u201CIt may be that the gulfs will wash us down; It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles whom we knew.%u201D</fieldset>
