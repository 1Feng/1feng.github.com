title: My run in with American Airlines at Code Works SFO -> LAX
---
<blockquote><p>Me: "I see why he left. Go inside the next time you check in." So much for friendly skies. #americanairlines</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Jeffery Carouth: What did you do?</p></blockquote>

<p>Started to respond on Facebook, but ran into their limit, so I'm responding on my blog...</p>

<p>Went to take my boarding pass that he was handing to me, then snapped that back at me.  Let me back up with the context.</p>

<p>I was standing in line at the curbside checkin with everyone else from CodeWorks '09.  The guy who's line I'm standing in takes a bag back to the conveyor, then disappears through another door.  I'm standing around looking dumbfounded while the other two guys are continuing to check people that came in after us.</p>

<p>Finally, I asked him if we lost the other guy or not?  "I don't know" then after he finishes with another person who just walked up he proclaims "next".  I walk over, start the process, everything's fine.</p>

<p>Then he calls me down to get my boarding pass and baggage check ticket.  He starts handing it to me (I thought) and is pointing out what's what.  I go to take it from him and he jerks it back and says "I see why the other guy left!"  Then mumbles something about this being for express check-in and next time I shouldn't park illegally and tie it up for people who know what they're doing.  He was old and not particularly articulate, so that combined with being floored by the lecture I didn't catch exactly what he said.</p>

<p>I rarely fly American anyhow, but you can bet I won't be flying on them again where I pay for the flight.</p>
