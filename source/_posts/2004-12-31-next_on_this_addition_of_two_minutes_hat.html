title: Next, on this addition of Two Minutes Hate...
---
<p>Seriously, doesn't the Pentagon have better things to do with $3 million than create their own television news station to "<a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20041226-114855-2257r.htm">cut out the middle man - the [pesky] national media</a>" (pesky is added by me...).  I don't know, maybe they could buy some armor with it...?  I wonder how long it will be until the Whitehouse and then Congress decides they need to get their message out directly to the people.  </p>

<p>I can see the <a href="http://www.pentagonchannel.mil/">PentagonChannel's</a> commercial breaks.  Instead of two minutes of commercials, they'll have the <em>Two Minutes Hate</em> disguised as the "real" scene from the War on Terrorism<small><sup>TM</sup></small> show Iraqis blowing coalition forces and each other.  They'll probably try to license (or claim fair use) on Lee Greenwood's <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Proud+to+be+an+American%22+&amp;btnG=Search">Proud to be an American</a>.  I don't know if they'll provide kiosks with bullet-proof glass over the screen and encourage individuals to act out their rage in public.  You know, sort of like a 21st century's burning of an effigy.</p>
