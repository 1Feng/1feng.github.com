title: A sports arenea for downtown Kansas City?

<p>
Looks like I might be one of the first to blog this, but the Mayor of Kansas City has a "major" announcement she's making this morning at 11 AM.  According to sources on the <a href="http://www.wdaftv4.com/">local Fox affiliate's</a> sources, they're saying it is the announcement of a downtown sports arena at 14th and Grand.  Sounds interesting...</p>
