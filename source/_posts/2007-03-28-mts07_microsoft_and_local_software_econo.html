title: MTS07 - Microsoft and Local Software Economy
---
<p>John Fernandes, johnfe@ - Director, International Business Development</p>

<p>He's a big time marathon runner.</p>

<p>The Local Software Economy Initiative is about creating new markets on governments and such by creating supply - getting people trained, companies using MS products, etc - and creating demand by getting companies and governments using the software.</p>

<p>His goal is drive relationships on a long-term basis.  Building long-term growth as "people deal with who they know".</p>

<p>This was a more economics based presentation.  Interesting, but it didn't keep my attention.  I ended up working on my <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Services_Amazon_S3+-+Travis+Swicegood">S3 proposal</a> on the Zend Framework.</p>
