title: I'm registered to vote!
---
<p><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/VoterRegistration.jpg" border="0" alt="Voter Registration Folks" class ="imgRight"/>Tonight I went down to <a href="http://www.crossroadscommunityassociation.org/faq.asp">First Fridays @ the Crossroads</a> and low and behold, they were registering to vote.  Here's a picture of the volunteers that got me registered!</p>

<p>I was informed that I should have been able to register at the voting station and voted immediately.  That from someone representing the KC Board of Elections.  It would have been nice if someone I talked to at the Chinn Elementary or the Platte County Board of Elections would have told me that.  Anyhow, now I'm registered - so watch out come November - my whole one vote is going to change the course of history! ;)</p>
