Shh... Don't tell my editor I'm blogging.  I'm procrastinating by writing this
blog post instead of working on *Programming Node*.  I'll still get to that,
but this is on the brain right now.

Today marks the [50th straight day][] of pushing code to GitHub.  My work on
[Armstrong][] has made a lot of this possible---it's easy to push code when
you're getting paid to write open source software---but not every day has been
Armstrong related code.

During the course of the last 50 days, I've rediscovered a few things that I
want to share, in case anyone else thinks that they can't possibly do this
without changing jobs.


## Keep it small
I've written about [manageable chunks][] in writing, but not in contribution.
It's easy to make excuses about why you aren't pushing code on a daily basis.
You need to clean the code up; its not good enough, yet; or it's not really
significant enough to make a difference.

Excuses.  All of them.

Every single piece of code you write has importance.  Otherwise you wouldn't
write it.  There are [exceptions][] to this [rule][], but those are outliers.
Most of the stuff you and I would write and go to the trouble of committing
is going to be useful to someone.

Case in point, earlier this week I helped add some interactivity to a
[timeline on the Texas Tribune][].  My contribution was trivial, but it might
be useful to someone trying to do something similar, so it's [up on GitHub][].


## There's always something
There is always something you can do with 5 minutes.  I've made a lot of
contributions to [bash-it][].  Think of it as your terminal on steriods, with
pretty colors.  I started out with some minor tweaks, then found some places
where code could be better handled, then other devs built on that, and I've
started refactoring some other parts.

I spend the vast majority of my time looking at a terminal, so it needs to fit
like a glove.  Working on bash-it means I'm getting more and more familiar with
my environment and making some pretty cool enhancements.

Find something that you use, something that would make your life a little bit
better if it just had X, then go to town and try to figure out how to do X in
it.  My bash programming sucks.  Seriously, I wouldn't know where to start to
write a real bash program, but I can muck around in the internals and figure
it out.  Just because you don't know how to program in a language doesn't mean
you: 1) can't, 2) shouldn't, 3) aren't fully capable of figuring it out as a
smart human being which I know at least *some* of you are.


## Just start
It's really easy to get part of the way through a month and say "oh, I'll start
the first of next month."  No.  No you won't.  Well, if you're me you won't. I
have a horrible tendency to want to go big or go home.  Not necessarily a bad
thing in and of itself, but not good for just getting shit done.â„¢

It's especially bad when "going big" is "I'm going to commit code every day in
a month" and you're already into an existing month.  Then ya wait and you lose
that initial momentum.

So the answer for me is to just start.  The raw #s are what matters.  Get out
there, do something, start tallying it up.
