title: National Championship Marathon race data

<p>And here's the data from my national championship ride.  You'll notice my exertion went way down on lap 5 and 6.  All of them were actually 4% lower than they should have been.  That still wasn't enough to win, but it would have made it closer.</p>

<p>And yes, there was over 2,000 more vertical feet of climbing at nationals than at Deer Valley.  For a non-mountain course, 11.5k (over 13k for the pros) of climbing in a day isn't too shabby.</p>
