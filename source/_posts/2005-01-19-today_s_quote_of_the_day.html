title: Today's quote of the day...

<p>WashingtonPost.com has a good article on the political battle that's going on internally in the Bush administration over global warming.  James Hanson says the administration is attempting to censor him.  Of Hason, Bush's chief science advisor, John Marburger said he is:</p>

<blockquote><p>"a very good climate scientist... I take his work seriously. His work has had a big impact on this administration's climate-change policy," Marburger said. "But he's not an economist. The fact that he's a good scientist does not necessarily make him the best person to formulate policy that would affect the economy."</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah yes, good science, bad economics.  I'm glad they have their priorities straight though.  I'd hate to see long term goals such as... oh I don't know, <strong>sustaining life as we know</strong> guide their policy.  It's much better that next year's 401ks do well.</p>
