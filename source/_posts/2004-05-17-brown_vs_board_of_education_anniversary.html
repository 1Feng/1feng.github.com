title: Brown vs. Board of Education Anniversary
---
<p>
Today makes the 50th anniversary of <a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/brown.html">Brown vs. Board of Education</a>.  On my way to lunch this afternoon, I listened to a portion of the Brown vs. Board of Education ceremony in Kansas.  The <a href="http://www.ksgovernor.org/">governor of Kansas</a>, Kathleen Sebelius, gave an excellent speech, with one exception.  She called for continued action to insure that each child receives the quality education that they are entitled to but failed to explain how she planned on making that call to action a reality within Kansas.  It's easy to say every child should receive the world's best education, it's a beast entirely different to explain how to go about that.</p>

<p>
On a side note, while I can't get a copy of Governor Sebelius' speech from this afternoon through your web site, in fact the <a href="http://www.ksgovernor.org/speeches.html">speeches</a> section of her site lists her last speech as the <a href="http://www.ksgovernor.org/news/docs/stateofstate_011204.html">2004 Kansas State of the State Address</a>, I can see in the <a href="http://www.ksgovernor.org/currentnews.html">current new</a> section that she "shot her first turkey".  Hmm, makes one wonder if the web site is there for informational purposes or to promote her to the NRA...</p>
