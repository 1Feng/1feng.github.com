<p>You've got to be kidding me.  Did McCain run a contest in rural American newspapers for his VP choice?</p>

<p>Oh wait, he really is that full of himself.</p>

<p>The second question was the one I've been waiting for someone to ask.  I would have loaded it even more:</p>

<blockquote><p>Senator, you stated in the debates last week that it would be a horrible idea to, and excuse me if I don't get the quote exactly right, "[hand] health care over to the government," yet for the majority of your adult life you have had government administered health care.  Have you had any problems with the government administered health care coverage that you have had for the better part of the last 50 years?</p></blockquote>

<p>Where's that question?  If government run health care is such a bad idea and would lower the quality of medical care that we receive, he should have been keeping his own private health care to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/medigap/default.asp">fill in the gaps</a> that he's helped create.</p>
