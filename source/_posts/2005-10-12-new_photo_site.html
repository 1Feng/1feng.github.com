title: New photo site
---
<p>Over the weekend I upgrade to <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery2</a>.  What a great piece of software.  Last night I put the finishing touches on making it look sort of like this site, and got everything moved over to its new home, <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/">photos.travisswicegood.com</a>.  In addition, I've put up the <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/photo-dump/sept-24-28-trip/">photo dump</a> of all my pictures while I was out in Arizona a few weeks ago.  There's over 250 in there, so some of the highlights include these <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/photo-dump/sept-24-28-trip/?g2_page=15">sunset pictures</a> and one of my favorites from the trip, <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/photo-dump/sept-24-28-trip/dsc05610.jpg.html">this lightning</a> caught from the plane on the trip back.</p>

<p>Last night while I was waiting on all those photos to get transferred to my server, I did do some editing and ended up with <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/american-southwest/northern-arizona/">these photos</a>.  In <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/american-southwest/northern-arizona/grand-canyon-explorer.jpg.html">this picture of the Grand Canyon</a>, there's a guy in blue just under the bush in the upper left.  If you can see the speck that he is, it  really helps put the scale of that picture in perspective.</p>
