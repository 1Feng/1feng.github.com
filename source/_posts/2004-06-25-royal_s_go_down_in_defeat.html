title: Royal's go down in defeat...
---
<p>Just got back in from a Royal's game, and tomorrow I will be posting some images on <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/">Me and Travis</a>.  I might even include some of the ones from last week's <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/06/19/trip_to_the_zoo">trip to the zoo</a>.  So mark your calendars - the 26th of June will be the time for new pictures on <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/">Me and Travis</a>.  Also, look for some other interesting sites to be posted here over the weekend.</p>
