title: Do I even still own bikes?
---
<p>Yes, I do.  I occasionally even ride them still :-)</p>

<p>Wow, this year has been really tough on me in the riding department and I'm not 100% sure why.  I was never able to get into a rhythm at all.  I've done a few races this year, very few, but felt strong at the ones I've been at.  Not top of my game strong, but an improvement over last year.</p>

<p>I like to blame work related BS, but that's not the case (entirely).  Starting the year off looking for a job wasn't fun.  I spent most of spring in a "should be perfect" job, but there wasn't much rhyme to it which threw things off even further.  In May I got on at Sugar and things got into a rhythm again and the job's going good, but I'd already lost my cycling momentum.  So I don't know... </p>

<p>Anyhow, that's why I haven't been posting about cycling.  It;s just been in a lull this year.</p>
