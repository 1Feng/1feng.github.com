title: Simoni prepares for the Tour de France
---
<p>
It is almost impossible to win both the Giro de Italia, and the Tour de France in the same year.  Winning one takes such a toll on your body, as Simoni demonstrated last year.  He dominated the early race in Italy only to finish in the 80's in France.  Could it be with this year's mediocre finish in the Giro, that he has decided that a Tour de France victory would be more important than a Giro win?  I wondered the same thing as the last stage of the Giro started today and within 15 minutes, Bob Roll asked the same question.</p>

I guess we'll find out come July...</p>
