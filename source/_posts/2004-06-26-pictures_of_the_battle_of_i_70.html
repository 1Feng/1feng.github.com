title: Pictures of the Battle of I-70
---
<p>The pictures of last nights game are going to be a bit delayed.  I have them sort of ready, but I'm using gThumb to generate a gallery of all of the images I have.  The only problem is I don't have the skin in place to make it look half-way descent, so...  I've been piddling with it getting everything setup for a bit over an hour already, so I need a break.  So, you're just going to have to wait.</p>
