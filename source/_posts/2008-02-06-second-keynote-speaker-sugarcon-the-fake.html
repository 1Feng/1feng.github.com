title: Second KeyNote speaker @ SugarCon - the fake Steve Jobs
---
<p>Here's a bunch of the funnier remarks from the <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">Fake Steve Jobs</a>.</p>

<ul><li>3,000 customers, some of those even pay... some of those even pay on time.</li>
<li>'did you ever notice that guys who are in to Eastern religions are the biggest assholes?'</li>
<li>"I don't hate freedom, it's like hating freedom!"</li>
<li>"Freetards" </li>
<li>"If you the biggest thing in your life is that you can't hack your Tivo, you need to get more things in your life."</li>
<li>"we have crazy right-wing born again people running our country and the thing that gets people crazy is DRM in iTunes?"</li>
<li>"You don't to raise $10 or $20 million dollars to start a company.  It's really bad news for Sun..."</li>
<li>"They (SugarCRM) were so excited [about the MySQL Sun deal] that they could hardly contain themselves"</li>
<li><i>The End of Open-Source Culture</i> - talking about how open-source is mainstreamed now.  He ripped the title from the article <i>The End f Gay Culture</i> which talks about it mainstreaming.</li>
<li>He thinks John will have body guards by the end of next year...</li>
<li>"The Cheap Revolutions"</li>
<li>Oracle isn't distributing Linux because they're nice - it's cause I think they want to kill Red Hat.</li>
<li>on Oracle's Linux: "You've been screwing up my database for a dozen years, so here, let me bend over and you can shove your OS in too..."</li>
<li>"The Pyramids of Giza, the Great Wall of China, then Properitary Software."  </li>
<li>"We'll be wow, that really happy."</li>
<li>"Larry's accomplished everything in his life, except beat Wilt Chamberlin's record.  And I'm not talking about in basketball.  [laughter] Some of you got that, right?"</li>
<li>"He's closing in - thanks to Vi-agra"</li>
<li>"I think MS and Yahoo coming together is like a taking a hundred yard dash and tying to legs of the 2nd and 3rd place runner together and asking for a rematch"</li>
<li>"the new office is like the dashboard of the spaceshuttle"</li>
<li>"you have to have help desk and a suicide line"</li>
<li>"The problem with the Stalinites don't buy anything..."</li>
<li>They love petitions, but they don't buy anything.</li>
<li>The COO of Delta is the now head of Red Hat?  That's like flying Microsoft</li>
<li>I don't want to joke about Red Hat because I think they might buy you...</li>
<li>Red Hat is like the Bermuda Triangle, they buy companies and they're never heard of again.</li>
<li>Question: "You've made fun of everyone but SugarCRM.  What do you say about them when you're at other people's conferences?"</li>
<li>"It's hard to make fun of these guys when they're on the right side..."</li></ul>

<p>His presentation was suffixed by a "in the 8 point font, these views weren't necessarily the views of SugarCRM." :-)</p>
