I've talked with a lot of PHP developers who are looking to jump from riding elephants to taming snakes.  The jump is obvious for those of us who like interpreted languages but want the feel of a really well designed language instead of getting glue all over ourselves.  I thought it was a relatively small trend, but now it seems <a href="http://www.phparch.com/">php|archtitect</a> has jumped ship too.  First it was their announcement of <a href="http://pymag.phparch.com/">Python Magazine</a>, now the January issue of php|arch supposedly contains exclusively Python articles! :-D</p>
