title: Talk about a depressing movie...
---
<p>I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/">Lord of War</a> yesterday and came away from its two hours thoroughly depressed.  The movie's entirety can be summed up in the following quote from Cage's character Yuri Orlov:</p>

<blockquote><p>They say, "Evil prevails when good men fail to act." What they ought to say is, "Evil prevails."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Update</em>: Reading through <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/trivia">IMDB's trivia on Lord of War</a> I finally get it.  This movie has the same feel to it that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362227/">The Terminal</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">The Truman Show</a> have, it feels real - there isn't a fluffed up Hollywood story to make it feel good, it's more about what is.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629272/">Andrew Niccol</a>, the writer of Lord of War, is responsible in some part for both of those movies.</p>

<p>Other interesting trivia:</p>
<ul><li>They used a real stockpile of over 3,000 AK-47s because it was cheaper than getting prop guns.</li>
<li>Before shooting the scene where tanks were lined up for sale, the filmmaker had to warn NATO, lest they think a real war was being started when they see satellite images of the set.</li>
<li>My personal favorite: <em>No US studios would back the film. Foreign finances were secured instead.</em></li></ul>
