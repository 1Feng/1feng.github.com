title: MTS07 - OSS at Microsoft with Sam Ramji
---
<p>Sam works at the OSS Labs.  Basically, his job is to figure out what open source software to help in the "coopertition".</p>

<p>He spent a little time on PHP.  MS has started to optimize IIS and it's integration with PHP so that Windows servers can be more competitive in that market.  As of now, IIS is orders of magnitude slower because of the current paradigm difference between Windows and Linux (threading versus processes).</p>

<p>Ugh...  It's 11:15 and I still have a headache.  </p>
