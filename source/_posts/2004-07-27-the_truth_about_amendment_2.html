title: The truth about Amendment 2
---
<p>I've heard some wild things of late about the proposed <a href="http://www.senate.state.mo.us/04INFO/bills/SJ029.htm">Amendment 2</a> that will be up for approval on next week's ballot.  Some are saying that failing to pass it will legalize same-sex marriage.  This is outrightly <strong>false</strong>.  Same-sex marriage is not condoned, performed, or acknowledged in the state of Missouri per <a href="http://www.moga.state.mo.us/statutes/C400-499/4510000022.HTM">Missouri Revised Statutes, Title XXX, Chapter 451, Section 451.022</a>.  In case you don't want to visit the page, here's what the current Missouri law states:</p>

<ol><li>It is the public policy of this state to recognize marriage only between a man and a woman.</li>
<li>Any purported marriage not between a man and a woman is invalid.</li>
<li>No recorder shall issue a marriage license, except to a man and a woman.</li>
<li>A marriage between persons of the same sex will not be recognized for any purpose in this state even when valid where contracted.</li></ol>

<p>Couple this with the federal <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9609/10/gay.marriage/">Defense of Marriage Act</a>, and Missouri is in no threat of being overrun by married gays.  Well, at least until those "rogue judges" recognize this discrimination for what it is...</p>

<p>On a side note, the <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/04info/billtext/tat/sj029.htm">original date</a> for this amendment was the November general election.  It's odd that they would want to hold this dire matter over an additional 3 months to November instead of getting it on the first ballot available.  Of course, I'm sure that had nothing to do with trying to insure the religious right came out in droves to vote in November.  No, politicians would never try to manipulate a vote in a swing state. ;) </p>
