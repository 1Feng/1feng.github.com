title: Pay for Parole?
---
<p>Am I the only one that finds <a href="http://www.newstribune.com/articles/2005/06/22/news_state/0062205033.txt">this odd</a>?  Aren't prisoners on parole supposed to be getting a second chance?  Doesn't this equal a poor tax seeing as how most prisoners are from lower income, more destitute situations?</p>

<p>Sometimes I can't help but shake my head...</p>
