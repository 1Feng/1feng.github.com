title: And now I've heard it all...
---
<p>Ok, just when you think you've heard everything from everybody, a tourist hits you out of the blue.  I went to <a href="http://www.gatesbbq.com/">Gate's</a> on Main today for lunch.  I'm standing in line waiting to pay, and the guy behind me, who had been studying the menu for a little longer than normal stepped up to the counter and asked if they had any <strong>salads</strong>.  It was all I could do to keep from chuckling.  I did turn away from him so he couldn't seem me smiling.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, what part of the world do you go to a BBQ place and ask for a salad?</p>
