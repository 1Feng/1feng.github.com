title: Google Analytics plugin for b2evolution
---
<p>I just finished up my first plugin for <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a>.  It adds the Google Analytics tracker code to the &lt;head&gt; section of your blog.  Simple really, but there's some quirkiness to b2evo's plugin system I wasn't thrilled with.  I'll save that rant for another post.  If you're using the latest version of b2evo and use Google Analytics, feel free to use <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/blogs/travis/code/d51googleanalytics.plugin.php.bz2" title="Domain51 Google Analytics">my plugin</a> to add it to your skin instead of hacking the skin.</p>
