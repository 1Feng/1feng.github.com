<p>After a few evenings of work, I think I have the new look of <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/">TravisSwicegood.com</a>.  The other design has been up for 3 or 4 years now.  Wow, I can't believe it's been that long.  At any rate, I think I like the new look.</p>

<p>If you notice anything weird, let me know.  There's probably still some quirks to work out, and I need to get my moblog displaying on this page.  Small steps, though... right?</p>
