title: Internet Explorer developers should be shot on sight
---
<p>
I wish we could shoot Internet Explorer developers on sight.  Their contributions to the human race an negligible, and they have done a lot of harm.  They won't support PNG images in their browser, which is a crime.  You know... I wonder if they own some of the rights of GIF images and they're laying in wait getting ready to pounce on everyone for using "<em>their</em>" image format illegally.</p>

<p>
Bastards... that's what they are...</p>

I've spent all day fiddling with CSS trying to get a beautiful design to work in IE.  It gets frustrating after awhile...</fieldset>
