title: Weekend in review
---
<p>Twelve hours is a long time to spend in a car driving solo in less than 60 hours, but that's what I did this past weekend.  The race went fairly well, I was in the bottom half of the overall Pro/Expert field, but felt great the whole race.  My goal was to finish and feel like I could have gone out for another lap, and I did.  I was on my Spider, but I felt so much more comfortable in a 29'er rhythm down around 75 - 80 RPM.  With that experience, I'm definitely going to take the 29'er up to the <a href="http://www.dawntilduskrace.com/">Dawn 'til Dusk</a> race.  I'll probably switch between the two bikes to see which one feels better and which one has better times</p>

<p>I learned this weekend that if I see something while packing and think to myself "nah, I won't need that", I will.  I had to buy some more <a href="http://www.notubes.com">Stan's</a> because I ripped a tire pre-riding the course Saturday.  I had a new tire, just no Stan's.  Also, when I got through with the ride I noticed one of my linkage bolts had started backing out.  I ended up having to take the crank off to figure out what I just had to pound it back in until it met the threads, then start tightening it.  Ahh... nothing like disassembling your bike the night before a race.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, the race went like I had hoped result wise - finished with energy to spare.  I had no speed though.  I could accelerate for 5 minutes or so, then I'd start backing off 'cause my mind was drifting.  If I thought about it again,  I could start pushing and picking up steam again.  I let heart attack hill get the better of though.  I was worried about having enough in me for that climb that I think I held back when I should have been pushing.  One of the curses of knowing the course too well and not knowing how your body will react to it I guess.</p>

<p>The weekend told me what I needed to know.  I've got a descent enough base to start moving over to the build phase now and start working on speed and power.</p>

<p>As far as placing, I did take 2nd and made my gas money back but I was way off of the first place pace, so there was no contesting that.  Based on previous early season racing though, I'm right where I want to be for a strong end of the year.  I've got the energy to complete the races even though I'm not really competing for wins.  By August though, I'll be a contender - at least at the regional level.  With the early season here in Arizona I'll hopefully be in a place where I can actually do something at the Coyote next year.</p>

<p>This coming weekend's Gallup.  12 hours of punishment.  Fun times :D</p>
