title: US Aid to the tsunami victims
---
<p>Am I the only American who's offended by the $35 million ponied up by President Bush?  We spent $4.3 billion to rebuild after the hurricanes <strike>in</strike> hit Florida and the other southern states this summer.  The best numbers I can find on Google put the death toll somewhere around 3 dozen.  The numbers - so far - have the death tolls across the countries hit at somewhere north of 72,000 and we're sending in $35 million to rebuild.</p>

<p>Put another way $486.11 per life lost outside the US.  $119,444,444.44 per life lost inside the US.</p>

<p>And the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200412/s1273813.htm">President's remarks</a> that "[he] felt like the person who made that statement was very misguided and ill-informed" where rather misguided.  Just do that math - or have Cheney do it for you.  Do you still this he was ill-informed?</p>
