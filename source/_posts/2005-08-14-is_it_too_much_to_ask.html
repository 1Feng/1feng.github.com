title: Is it too much to ask?
---
<p>All I want to do is install <a href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a> and I would be thrilled if I could get <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~clkao/SVN-Mirror-0.65/">SVN::Mirror</a> working so I can mirror a few OS projects that are hosted in CVS servers.  Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>Trac is being held up by this error:</p>
<blockquote><p>ImportError: libsvn_swig_py-1.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes - the python bindings are installed, and yes, that file does exist.</p>

<p>SVN::Mirror on the other hand, is being held up by Subversion itself.  <cite>make swig-pl</cite> won't even happen...  The error that I get there:</p>
<blockquote><p>core.c:1139: syntax error before "apr_pool_t"</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not much of a C programmer, so I'm not sure what's what there.  I've tried fiddling with it a bit, but nada...</p>

<p>This is a frustrating way to spend a Sunday morning.</p>
