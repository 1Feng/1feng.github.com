<p>Or at least today.  <a href="http://blogkc.com/archives/2005/01/school-funding-debate/">BlogKC</a> had a teaser for <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/97A671D0F245939286256F8A00221A20?OpenDocument&amp;Headline=Missouri+school+funding+is+under+fire">STL Post-Dispatch's article</a> on school funding in Missouri.  It's a good article, and worth the read, but the closing is priceless:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I cannot sit in the Missouri Capitol and worry about what some judge is going to do," said House Budget Committee Chairman <a href="http://www.house.state.mo.us/bills041/member/mem004.htm">Brad Lager</a>, R-Maryville.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yeah - it's not his concern if the laws he's passing or the budgets he's approving are legal, or constitutional or any of those minor things like that - he's just got to pass them!  Is it just me, or does that seem to be the political equivilant of "kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out!"?</p>
