title: "Race Report: God's Country Duathalon"
---
<p>Wow.  It's been a <b>long</b> time since I've written one of these.  Yesterday I participated in my first race in near (if not over) two years!  Time flies, etc.</p>

<p>Yesterday wasn't a traditional mountain bike race, it was a duathalon.  God's Country Duathalon, 4 mile trail run, 12 mile mountain bike loop.  Before you go getting all impressed at my multi-sport abilities: I didn't run, I raced a relay.  A friend of ours is training for the Lincoln Marathon, which is next week, so the 4 mile trail run was a nice warm-up for the real festivities.</p>

<p>If yesterday's run is any indication, she'll do great next week.  I was hoping for a sub 40 minute time and she came in at a touch over 35 minutes.  I knew there was at least one co-ed team in front of us, so I was off.  The River Trails are really fun for 29'ers.  You get in the big ring and never leave it.  The lowest gear I hit the whole race was 44x28.  It's a really ripping course.</p>

<p>We did a lap and a half.  The first lap I picked off at least 30 riders.  Most of 'em were solo, but I saw a few 700 numbers on legs as I went by.  It felt amazing to be riding against a clock that wasn't on my handlebars again.  It's been way too long for that feeling.</p>

<p>I wasn't running a clock, so I don't have the exact time, but I believe I turned the 8 mile lap in a bit under 35 minutes.  The half lap was good too.  Before I knew, I'd covered the two miles to the turn around and was heading back.  I got caught up in a few places where riders were starting to pile up which lost a bit of time, but everyone's out there to race, so ya can't complain.  Once I hit the levy for the two mile leg back, I turned it up.  There was one guy about 200 yards in front of me that I couldn't close down any gap on, but I pulled in another 6 or 7 riders there too.  The 29'er wheels with a 44 big ring really leg ya crank it out on those long straight aways.</p>

<p>We ended up with 2nd place.  I was 51 seconds off of closing down the gap to first place.  Really makes me wonder if that wasn't the guy who was up in front of me that I didn't catch on the levy.  If that's the case, we were about 100' away from each other on the singletrack and I was closing.  Too bad there wasn't more single track. :-)</p>

<p>I'm happy though.  I felt strong and pulled us into 3rd place in the overall relay and 2nd in the co-ed.  Out of some 9 or 10 relay teams, I'll take it.</p>

<p>With the leg only being 12 miles, it felt really short.  The last race I did was the twelve hour race in Gallup as part of a team.  I think I put in right at six hours on the bike that day.  There was a mountain bike race after the duathalon, and though my legs still felt good, I knew I didn't have that kind of juice in 'em for two short races.  Now, had this one gone for another 12 or even 24 miles, I'd have been stoked.</p>

<p>It's nice to see that the legs are still there, even with all of the neglect and abuse I've given them in the last few years.  The nice thing is that I really think my lungs are just high altitude only at this point.  I pushed my legs a few times into the red zone yesterday, but my heart and lungs were in great shape.  I don't think it'd take much to get back into race shape again.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this won't be the last of these for the year.  I have a few races in mind I'd like to make, just a matter of everything lining up properly.</p>
