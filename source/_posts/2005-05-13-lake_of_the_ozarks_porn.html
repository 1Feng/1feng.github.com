title: Lake of the Ozarks Porn?
---
<p>You better believe it!  I'm all about the Lake of the Ozarks porn.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm kidding, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=lake+of+the+ozarks+porn">Google</a> thinks that only <a href="http://www.playboy.com/playboytv/original_series/sexcetera/shows.html">Playboy</a> has more to do with "Lake of the Ozarks porn".  </p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder how in the world they come up with these search results...</p>

<fieldset><p><legend>Author's note</legend>I feel obligated to say that I don't actually go searching Google trying to figure out where the local porn scene is - that's better left to cruising local adult book store bulletin boards... but I digress.  <a href="http://www.b2evolution.net">b2evolution.net</a> actually keeps track of all of visitors I get from search engines.  Among the other oddball searches I've got today:</p>

<ul><li>"<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=shaving+mountain+biking">shaving mountain biking</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=the+devil%27s+advocate%2C+bible+verses">devil's advocate, bible verses</a>" - Am I the devil's advocate?  It'd be nice if he'd tell me these things...</li>
<li>"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=So+you%27re+in+love+with+a+Narcissist&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N">So you're in love with a Narcissist</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=crossroads+district+kansas+city">crossroads district kansas city</a>" - these always pick up around <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php?cat=75">First Friday's</a></li></ul></fieldset>
