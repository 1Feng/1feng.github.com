title: Blog software update...
---
<p>I just finished upgrading my blog software to the latest, hopefully greatest <a href="http://b2evolution.net/news/2007/12/29/b2evo-2-3-0-renaissance-released">b2evolution</a>.  This was by far the most painful of the upgrades.  Every time I've upgrade before, the <a href="http://manual.b2evolution.net/Main_Page">manual</a> has been invaluable.  This time, no so much. :-/</p>

<p>Anyhow, if you find anything amiss, please leave a comment or email me.  Actually, leave a comment anyhow, I need to make sure everything is working. ;-)</p>
