<p>"Umm... That's not supposed to happen."  :)</p>

<p>The guys at <a href="http://bicycleshowcase.com/">Bicycle Showcase</a> were surprised when I showed up with that damper cartridge.  So either the guy before me had a nack for harsh landings off of second story balconies, or there was some sort of defect.  They were going to call <a href="http://www.marzocchi.com/spa/mtb/?LN=UK&amp;Sito=mtb">Marzocchi</a> up and see if they'll warranty it, and if not order one for me.</p>

<p>And who would have thought a 28mm socket would be so hard to find?  No one in Fountain Hills has one!</p>
