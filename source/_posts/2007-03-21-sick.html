title: "Sick?  "
---
<p>Ugh...  I'm fighting what seems like the start of a cold.  I think it's more allergies than anything, but this isn't good timing.  I'm supposed to be heading up to Redmond next week for a Microsoft Technology Summit.  Should be fun - assuming I don't really get sick.  It's Microsoft's patented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish">EEE</a> methodology.  So far I'm the only PHP guy I've found looking at <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?q=%22microsoft%20technology%20summit%22&amp;hl=en">blog postings</a> from the last few months.</p>
