title: Charles Murray and blogs
---
<p>Very cool... I just got mentioned on <a href="http://www.booktv.org/InDepth/murray.asp">C-SPAN's BookTV</a>!  The author <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Charles%20Murray%22">Charles Murray</a> mentioned that he reads blogs as part of his morning routine - so I emailed to ask if he keeps one, and why or why not.</p>

<p>He said he's not a first-draft writer.  He continually reworks <strike>what</strike> his writing until he finally reaches the end point, thus writing for a blog wouldn't quite work out.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that his personal writing style relies on drafting in the form of writing out a full version, then reworking it.  To me, it shows a talent that was honed prior to the ubiquity of computers and word processors.  Personally, as I write, I am constantly reworking the piece.  Sometimes it is to my own detriment - a sentence might look right as a read it, but as I <em>edit</em> it later it doesn't fit.  Nonetheless, I wonder how many other bloggers make drafts of their work, and how many of them constantly revise like I do.</p>

<p>Here's the email I sent it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Question for Charles Murphy</em><br /><br />
Hello Mr. Murray,</p>

<p>You mentioned that you read blogs as part of your morning routine.  Do you keep a blog?  Why or why not?</p>

<p>If you happened to hear it, they mispronounced my name.  It's pronounced like <em>twice</em> with an <em>s</em> not like swiss cheese.</p>
