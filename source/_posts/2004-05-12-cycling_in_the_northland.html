title: Cycling in the Northland
---
<p>
Went for a ride tonight.  Great stuff, huh?  The Northland in Kansas City is really great for cycling.  There's a multitude of empty country roads where you can pedal to your heart's content.  The only thing that messes up this cycle-induced nirvana are the self-absorbed roadiacs (it's my blog, I can make up words if I want) who speed their souped up family <a href="http://www.pontiac.com/grandam/index.jsp?brand=home&amp;pagename=home">sedans</a> or quasi-military vehicles (I would link, but I don't want to subject you to the flash intro at Hummer.com) along with no care in the world about anyone else.  "Hell, if I get in an accident, it ain't me that's going to get hurt.  The momentum's with me and/or I'll just run 'em over."</p>

<p>
It's not that I have a thing against those types of cars.  I love a big utility vehicle or fast car as much as the next guy.  It's the self-absorbedness that they represent.  Most people don't need a car that can do -6 second 0-60 runs.  Most people don't need a vehicle that can be dropped from a helicopter at 1000 feet and still be drivable.  They just want the vehicle, the environment and other motorists be damned.</p>

<p>
But who cares...?  Right?  It's not like the money that they pump into those vehicles every other day at the gas station does any harm.  I mean, terrorists aren't in OPEC.  No... the contractors that set the pipe lines in Saudi don't actually have any ties to Al Qaeda.  Oh wait, they do?  Then I guess the self-absorbed individuals who are too busy with their own life to be courteous when they pass me on my bike are funding terrorism, too.  And here I was just thinking they were inconsiderate.</p>
