title: First Fridays May 2005 Recap
---
<p>I'm back from <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php?cat=75">First Fridays</a> tonight.  I don't feel like I know <em>that</em> many people in Kansas City, but I couldn't go 15 or 20 minutes without running into someone I knew.  Weird how that works.</p>

<p>Anyhow, tonight was by far the best First Friday of the year.  When I got back to my car at 9:30, the tempature was still 75!  It was perfect weather.  I took a <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/kansas-city-first-fridays-may-2005-raw">ton of pictures</a>.  I'm uploading the 244 pictures I took between 5 and the time my battery finally ran out about 8:45.  These are all raw images with no post-production on them, so keep that in mind.  If I get the time over the weekend, I'll finish some of them up.  There's also going to be a ton of pictures of the same people (probably the first 60 or 70).  It was <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/kansas-city-first-fridays-may-2005-raw/DSC04367">Judy's</a> birthday, so I hung out with them and took a lot of pictures before venturing forth to the rest of the festivities.</p>
