title: "NPR : 'Brown v. Board:' Letters to Eisenhower"
---
<p>
On my way home from work today I was listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> - yes, I do have a habit called NPR - and they <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/">All Things Considered</a> had a very provocative piece called <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1899657">Brown v. Board: Letters to Eisenhower</a> which consisted of approximately 10 minutes of letters addressed to the then President in the wake of the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling.  Many were for, many were against, but they all offered a glimpse into a not-so-distant past what we would do well to remember.</p>
