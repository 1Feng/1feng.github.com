title: Petacchi has "double-turbo" on his bike
---
<p>
Petacchi takes another stage win today.  The commentators said he was "looking too cool" with 400 meters to go as he didn't immediately cover the final attack.  His guy who was playing it cool ended up a half a bike length in front of his nearest challenger and nearly three in front of the original attacker, Pollack who finished 4th.</p>

On another note, McEwen got disqualified in today's finish.  He got a push from one of his team mates which catapulted him from about 10th to Petacchi's wheel.</p>
