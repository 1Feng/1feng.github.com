<p>I'm trying to keep from finishing up my packing and killing some time online to do so when I thought I'd Google "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=SugarCon">SugarCon</a>" to see what was up.</p>

<div class="image_block"><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/blogs/travis/sugarcon-google.jpg" alt="" title="" width="477" height="295" /></div>

<p>Yup - that's right.  First Sugar, then Reuters, then me. :-)</p>
