title: b2evolution 0.9 upgrade

Wow!  Great job Francois!  The upgrade took about 10 minutes and most of that was spent figuring out where my customizations were.  Very smooth.  One thing did cause some trouble though, the datbase password field seemed to get eaten by the config script when I chmod'd _config.php.  A bug maybe?</p>
