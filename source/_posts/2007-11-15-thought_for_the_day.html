<p>A buddy of mine broke his collar bone on Monday out riding some trails north of Kansas City.  This was posted to an email list in response talking about how well/quickly it would heal:</p>

<blockquote><p>... there's an old saying in orthopedics:  "If the two ends of the clavicle (broken collar bone) are in the same room, they'll heal."</p></blockquote>
