title: Edwards announces for 2008
---
<p>Let the games begin.  <a href="http://johnedwards.com/">Edwards</a> announced today, albeit, a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/27/AR2006122701452_pf.html">day early</a>.  I think this guy could make a good President and if he plays his cards right might have a shot at winning... So long as <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/09/08/imagine_if">this ad</a> doesn't run.</p>
