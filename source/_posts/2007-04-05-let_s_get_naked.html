title: Let's get naked!
---
<p>I just saw <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2007/apr/my-first-css-naked-day">Chris' post</a> on <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day</a> and decided to join in the fun and get naked.</p>

<p>No <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> for the rest of the day and in to tomorrow (at least until I remember to turn it back on).  For those of you who don't know, CSS is what makes my site pretty (or ugly depending on your point of view).  When I pull it out, you get this raw format.  It's intelligible without all of the mark-up.</p>

<p>It's amazing the number of sites with bad usability if you have images turned off (say you're blind and you have some sort of browser reader reading the site's content for you).  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">WhiteHouse.gov</a> is my favorite.  Should be the most accessible site online, but nope.</p>

<p>Anyhow, happy <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">Naked Day</a> to ya...</p>
