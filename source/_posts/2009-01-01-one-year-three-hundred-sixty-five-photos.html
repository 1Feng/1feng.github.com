title: One Year - Three Hundred Sixty Five Photos

<br /><blockquote>People will often say that their whole lives flashed before their eyes after they experienced a traumatic event. Perhaps it's a bit morbid, but we think that sounds pretty incredible.</blockquote>

That's taken from <a href="http://www.photojojo.com/content/tutorials/project-365-take-a-photo-a-day">this post</a> that introduces people to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/project_365/">Project 365</a>.  Project 365 is one of the undertakings for 2009 that I alluded to in <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/12/31/2008-a-retrospective">my last post</a>.  The goal is simple.  Take and share at least one photo, every day, all year long.  At the end of the year, you've got an amazing collection that shows your year.  Here's my first entry:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tswicegood/3157201391/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3152/3157201391_7051db4ee6.jpg?v=0" alt="Ingredient Shadows" /></a>

I took the shot at Ingredient as Meg an I were finishing up a late lunch.  I'm pleased with it, so now the bar is set pretty high for the rest of the year.  All of my photos are going to be published to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tswicegood/sets/72157611973559115/">my 365 set</a> on <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> if you're keen on watching this little experiment.
