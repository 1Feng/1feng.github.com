title: AOL's new TV advertisements
---
<p>Is it just me, or do the new AOL advertisements seem rather "high and mighty"?  As if they can make the Internet better.  <em>They</em> don't own the Internet.  They just plug into it, then filter your experience to their liking.  </p>

<p>AOL has consistently resisted the Internet - their email being a prime example.  Until recently all AOL email sent from AOL to a non-AOL email address was rendered in plain-text.  The reason?  AOL refused to use HTML/RTF to format email messages per the Internet standard - instead, they used their own proprietary methods.</p>

<p>But I guess since they invented the Internet - with Al Gore's help, of course - they have the right to claim that they, and they alone, can make it bette<em>r</em>.</p>
