<p><a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/index.php?title=happy_birthday_travis&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">There's this</a>, and <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws/newmedia?title=php_the_best_computer_language_in_the_un&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1#c174">this</a>, and then <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/01/04/abu_musab_al_zarqawi_reportedly_arrested#c150">this</a>, not to mention a flood of emails...</p>

<p>Anyhow - today's my birthday.  No big plans.  If you're dying to do something for me, head over to the <a href="https://www.redcross.org/donate/donation-form.asp">Red Cross</a> and donate some money.  They're going to need all of it they can get.</p>
