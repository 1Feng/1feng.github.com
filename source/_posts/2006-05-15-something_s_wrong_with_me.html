title: Something's wrong with me
---
<p>Everyone who knows me probably already knows this, but I determined this morning that something is wrong with me.  My eyes were wide up at 5:30 AM this morning without an alarm clock.  And what do I do?  Roll over and go back to sleep like a normal person would that didn't have to be up that early?  Nope.  I thought "Great, I can eat breakfast and get in a ride before I go in to work this morning.  Sweet!"</p>
