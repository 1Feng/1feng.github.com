title: Quick update...
---
<p>Less than a week to go...  I'm excited.  I've found the best way to describe it is anxious anticipation.  I can't wait to be back "home" in the desert, but it is going to be wierd being half a country away from my family.</p>

<p>I'm down to the final things to pack - my books, my bikes, and my computers.  I started my books today and all of my miscellaneous biking stuff is already packed up. I still have all my bikes out though, and hope to get in another ride before I head out west.  With the weather of late, I don't think it's going to cooperate.</p>

<p>Back to the grindstone.  I need to get my room back to some semblance of ordered so I have room to sleep tonight.  If you're curious what my nephew looks like, check out these <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/swicegood-family/the-jones/alexander-james/">pictures</a> I took the other day.  My favorites are <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/swicegood-family/the-jones/alexander-james/dsc05656-005-bw.jpg.html">this one</a> and <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/swicegood-family/the-jones/alexander-james/dsc05643-003-bw2.jpg.html">this one</a> - I just wish the first one was in focus, but he was moving so fast I couldn't keep him perfectly in focus.  I have to give <a href="http://aptrick.deviantart.com/">Pappy</a> props on the idea for the border.  He uses a different aspect ratio than I do, but I love the black band idea.</p>
