title: "PHPT: A teaser..."
---
<p>So my free time of late (what there is of it) has been spent on a project that's getting really close to v0.1 release.  In other words, its first functional release.  As a teaser to what it might entail, consider this code that I just ran on my server:</p>

<pre>$ ./scripts/phpt --recursive --reporter PearQuiet tests \
&amp;&amp; pear run-tests -rq tests
Running 392 tests
TOTAL TIME 00:24
392 PASSED TESTS
0 SKIPPED TESTS
Running 392 tests
TOTAL TIME: 00:31
392 PASSED TESTS
0 SKIPPED TESTS</pre>

<p>If you've ever run a test using the PEAR installer or know what a <code>.phpt</code> file looks like, you might be able to guess what I've been up. :-)  Stay tuned for more info...</p>
