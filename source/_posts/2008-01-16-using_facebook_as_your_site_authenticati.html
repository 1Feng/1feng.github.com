title: Using Facebook as your site authentication layer
---
<p>I'm always kicking around ideas for various applications.  One thing I look to off-load is user-authentication.   <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> has always caught my eye when I start thinking about that, but there's been something nagging at the back of my brain about offloading something as critical as allowing users to log-in to something that is centralized.  It becomes your single point of failure.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm seeing that the unease was justified.  Had an hour or so this morning before I started work that I was going to tinker with a small Facebook app I've been cooking up, but <a href="http://forum.developers.facebook.com/viewtopic.php?id=7080">FB is completely on the fritz</a> for all small apps.  Imagine if that was powering my login mechanism...</p>

<p>Just another strike against <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/10/17/twitterific_distributed_versus_centraliz">centralized services</a> like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
