<p>XNA - the marketing term for "Next generation game development platform for PC and XBox 360".  The "running joke is XNA is Not an Acronym".</p>

<p>He's going through a history of gaming langauges starting with the ASM guys back in the day saying that C++ required too much memory to work and then the C++ guys saying .NET wouldn't work.  Could you imagine what would happen if they went back to ASM with modern hardware?  It's be freaky kind of fast!</p>

<p>Just miscellaneous stuff - I'm tired, but I finally got rid of the headache around noon after I scored a few Advil from Tanya.  They're giving all of us a year's subscription to MSDN to have access to their programs.</p>

<p>He's going through some XBox Live stuff.  They have downloadable games, things like that.  Sort of like a console version of what you've been able to do with your phone for half a decade.</p>

<p>XNA is going to be available as a subscription service.  $99/year gets you the license you need to create games.  The "Creator's Club" is required to develop and use the XNA games.</p>

<p>The Xbox .NET framework is based off of the mobile device framework.</p>

<p>"That has never happened... " :-)</p>
