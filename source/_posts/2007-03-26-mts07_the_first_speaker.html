<p>Just stream of consciousness notes during the presentation...</p>

<p>Bill Hilf, General Manager Platform Strategy MS Corp.</p>

<p>Talking mostly about open source software.  He's putting a lot of stress on not being an apologist.  Ouch - bad blue pill joke.  "I guess you could say I took the blue pill and joined IBM".</p>

<p>Microsoft is the "most manically self-critical company" spending 58 minutes of an hour meeting talking about "how we suck".</p>

<p>He constantly is defending the "Linux is un-American" comments and claims them as "the gum on [his] shoes".</p>

<p>The two secrets to Microsoft: Write a piece of software that can run on 100's of millions of hardware, and software that can run 100's of millions of programs using a common API."  Response from the crowd: "that's called Java". :-)</p>

<p>He's really pushing <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com">SugarCRM</a> as a good opensource relationship with MS and open source.</p>

<p>Port 25 is the place to get info on MS opensource.  CodePlex is their OSS portal (i.e., Sourceforge).  CodePlex allows any time of software regardless of license.</p>

<p>"Coopetition..."  Cooperation and Competition.  Must be the internal replacement to Embrace, Extend, Extinguish.  Recommends Blue Ocean Stragety.</p>

<p>"One of the <em>mythologies</em> of open source companies is that it's just about services" (paraphrase).  The idea is to differentiate your product to make money.</p>

<p>Six lessons:</p>

<ol><li>Patience is key</li>
<li>Learn what you can handle</li>
<li>Invest in friends and skilled allies</li>
<li>Identify goals and sitable targets</li>
<li>The right place at the right time (find your own pace)</li>
<li>Use all resources - "Play long, play hard, and use as many sources as you see fit"</li></ol>

<p>All of these are straight out of the strategy book for World of Warcraft.  His email is billhilf@ - if you can't figure out the rest, you shouldn't be reading this :-)</p>

<p>He keeps mentioning SugarCRM and PHP - as two different things.  That's good for Sugar that they've got themselves defined outside of the context of the language.</p>

<p>During the QA:</p>

<p>"I don't care... I don't even know what Java is" - a quote from the head of an ER at one of the local hospitals in Redmond.  That's the lesson, people don't care what technology powers software, so long as it works.</p>

<p>Whats the difference between SF and CodePlex?  SF has to be under an OSI license.  MS wanted to provide a license-agnostic MS community.</p>

<p>Speculation on OSI licensing - would they consider it?  Absolutely, we just have to work it out.  He has a hard time with the ideology of open source separate of the software.  "We don't believe in all of them"...  Guess no GNU/Windows anytime soon... :-)</p>

<p>Thoughts on GPLv3 - "It's hard to talk about GPLv3 because it's constantly in flux."</p>

<p>Why didn't you use the ODF instead of doing your own with OpenXML?  It's not a "save as" text standard.  His claim is that they're different technically in that Microsoft Office uses OpenXML in a different way than serializing data to the disk.</p>

<p>"You want the competition - the VHS versus Betamax, the HDDVD from Blueray."  From the crowd: "Nobody with have a brain will believe that comment coming from you."</p>

<p>Closing Notes:<br />
He was good.  The OpenXML is a touchy issue for sure.  I may expand these once I get more time...</p>
