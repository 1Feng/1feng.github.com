title: Still on terra firma
---
<p>About now I should be picking up my bag in <abbr title="San Jose, California Airport">SJC</abbr>, but less than an inch of ice killed Southwest today.  All of the flights from <a href="http://www.flykci.com/">KCI</a> today have been canceled.  Well, nearly all of them, but I didn't want to spend 9 hours for a 5 hour flight.  I was booked for a flight via LAX first thing in the morning, but it's already been canceled and all of the flights that get me in to San Jose before noon are full or canceled.  I'm just going to hang out here so I can actually get something done tomorrow and I'll spend Thursday and Friday out there.</p>

<p>At this rate, driving to Denver to catch a flight would have been nearly as quick. :-/</p>
