title: Furl - The Travis Swicegood Tour de France 2004 Archive
---
<p>I'm gearing up for tomorrow's start to the <a href="http://www.furl.net/forward.jsp?id=504809">Tour de France</a>.  Of course, I will be blogging the whole tour here, on TravisSwicegood.com, but I will also be FURL'ing the Tour as well.  <a href="http://www.furl.net">FURL</a> is a tool that allows you to store copies of a web page.  Through it, you will be able to see all of the websites I am using for information about the Tour.</p>
