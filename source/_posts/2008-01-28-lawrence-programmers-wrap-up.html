<p>Wow, is it already next week?  I meant to post this the next day, but one thing lead to another and another and - well, now it&#39;s the next week.</p><p>We ended up moving the time around a bit and met at 7 at the?<a href="http://www.eldridgehotel.com/">Eldridge Hotel</a>?to catch none other than the (in)famous?<a href="http://greg.chiaraquartet.net/">Greg Beaver</a>?and the?<a href="http://www.chiaraquartet.net/">Chiara String Quartet</a>. ?After forty-five minutes of chamber music, we hit Rudy&#39;s Pizzeria for a few beer and shop talk. ?In total, we ended up with 7 people, which was approximately 5 more than I thought we&#39;d have when I first announced it... ;-)</p><p>There was definitely an interest, so the plan is to try to meet on the 4th Tuesday for a few months and see how it goes. ?The discussion turned to TDD and?<a href="http://phpt.info">PHPT</a>?and since there were a lot of guys who hadn&#39;t been exposed to it at all, the?<a href="http://traviscline.com/blog/">other Travis</a>?volunteered me for an introduction to TDD for?<a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=8339313461">next month&#39;s meeting</a>. ?I haven&#39;t focused in on the specifics of the presentation yet, but I&#39;m thinking something patterns oriented like how to roll your own MVC framework using TDD instead of the standard &quot;how to verify that 2 + 2 equals 4&quot; style of tests. ?Might be too much for one hour, but I bet I could do it in 90 ;-)</p><p>If you&#39;re in the area on February 26<sup>th</sup>, be sure to stop by the?<a href="http://www.lawrence.lib.ks.us/">Lawrence Public Library</a>?around 7.</p>
