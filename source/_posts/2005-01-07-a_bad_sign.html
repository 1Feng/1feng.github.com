title: A bad sign?
---
<p>I'm not one for signs or anything, but it is kind of odd that I find this out on my birthday.  This morning someone came to my site via Google.  Ok, so you're right.  There's nothing odd about that, I get hundreds of hits from Google during any given month.  What's odd about this one is that it's #4 on a phrase that has 1,110,000 results.  So what's the phrase?</p>

<p>"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=something+meaningless">something meaningless</a>"</p>

<p>At least it's a <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/12/complete_devotion_to_something_that_s_ab">good post</a>.</p>
