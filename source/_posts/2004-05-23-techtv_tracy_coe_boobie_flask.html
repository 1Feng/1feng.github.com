I'm afraid I might be dying...  I have now seen it <strong>all</strong>.  The <a href="http://www.techtv.com/inventthis/inventors/story/0,24330,3588319,00.html">Boobie Flask</a> lets women store their favorite adult beverage in the bra.  I guess they figure beer goggles will kick in and the guys won't noticed they dropped a cup size or two.</p>

<p>
Man - I'll bet there's a mad rush for security jobs when these hit the market.  "Here, I'll pat people down checking for illegal booze...  You don't even have to pay me!"  Yup, I can here 'em now.</p>
