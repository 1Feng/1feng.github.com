title: Recording TV-IN in Linux
---
<p>
One word of advice - don't do it!  It's really not worth the time.  I've probably spent a good 4 - 5 hours piddling with <a href="http://www.ati.com/products/tvwonderve/index.html">this darn card</a>.  I can watch TV, but recording... Forget about it.  And timer recording?  Ha!  You're making me laugh! :></p>
