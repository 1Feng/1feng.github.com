title: CSS Naked Day
---
<p>My second year participating in the <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day</a>.  Getting a bit of a late start (it's already 11), but my site will be sans-CSS for the rest of the day to show how readable sites can be that use CSS for all of their layout.</p>

<p>Looking at my site, I need to move the menu so its positioned via CSS instead of falling semantically at the top.  With that change, this will be as good as the previous incarnation of my site which was 100% semantic. :-)</p>
