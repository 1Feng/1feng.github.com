title: A 24 hour solo for fun?
---
<p>Last night I read <a href="http://teamdicky.blog.com/776930/">Dicky's How to have fun and race solo at the same time</a> about racing a 24 hour solo for the hell of it.  Riding around this morning on my recovery ride, it got me thinking.  I was going to skip the upcoming <a href="http://www.tucsonracing.com/PSMinf06.htm">Payson Stampede</a> because I would haven't enough time to recover from a full on 12 hour event going into nationals.  This morning it dawned on me, why not do it solo for the hell of it?</p>

<p>I wouldn't be out there to kill myself.  I'd set limits on how many laps I could ride, etc.  I want to do the <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/twofour/24.htm">24 Hours in the Old Pueblo</a> next year and actually try to put up a respectible finish, but this would give me a chance to do a 24 hour race solo so I have a better feel for what I'm up against.  Hmm...</p>

<p>Best part of Dicky's article</p>
<blockquote><p>It took a few laps of quiet introspection to come to a semi-profound realization. I don't have sponsors, my parents already love me, and I don't care what others think of me, so why give a rat's ass what gets posted. I knew my goals and that's all that really mattered in the end.</p></blockquote>

<p>The only draw back is paying $135 (or $150 if I wait two more days) to go ride.  I can do that for free, but then I can't say I've done a 24 hour race then either.</p>
