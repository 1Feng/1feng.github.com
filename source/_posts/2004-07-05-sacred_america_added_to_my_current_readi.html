title: Sacred America - Added to my current readings
---
<p>I'm working on a book by Roger Housden called Sacred America.  I actually started it nearly a year ago in El Paso, but it has been packed up until this past weekend.  After "rediscovering" it and realizing I still had my place marked, I decided to give it a read this evening.</p>

<p>It is an amazing book, offering insights to the various spiritual paths that have manifested themselves inside the US.  The chapter I read this evening dealt with two Georgian spiritual movements, that found in Americus and the Habitat for Humanity headquarters and the Auburn district of Atlanta and Ebenezer Chapel with a brief touch of a suburban Unity Church.  All three different, yet all three the same.  From my recollection of the book Housden has done a great job tying the seemingly "different" spiritual practices together in their commonality.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0684848384%3Fv%3Dglance">this book</a> to anyone who would like to read a book about the uplifting side of America.</p>
