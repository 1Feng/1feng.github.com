title: The tsunami in context
---
<p>Amy Gahran has an excellent piece on the human effect of tsunami.  This piece showcases her excellent writing skills like no other I've read of hers.  It is truly a touching piece.</p>

<blockquote><p>Please let yourself, even for a moment, feel fully connected to humanity. Experience our fragility and strength, as a species and as individuals. Then, do whatever you can within the context of your life to aid humanity. Be good to the people in your life, help them flourish. Expand your sense of community and welcome new individuals into your direct experience.</p></blockquote>
