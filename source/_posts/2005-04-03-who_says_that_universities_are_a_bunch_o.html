title: Who says that universities are a bunch of lefties?
---
<p>Just in case you thought all college-aged folk were leftists, UMKC's <a href="http://www.unews.com/main.cfm?include=section&amp;section_id=271192">University News</a> published <a href="http://www.unews.com/news/2005/03/28/Forum/Social.Security.Reform.Is.Still.Government.Welfare-904706.shtml">this article on Social Security</a>.</p>

<p>The sad thing - I really think he's missed the entire point of what social security is all about.  To him, it's a hand-out and thus bad.</p>
