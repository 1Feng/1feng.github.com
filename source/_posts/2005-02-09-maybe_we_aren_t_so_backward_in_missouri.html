title: Maybe we aren't so backward in Missouri...

<p>Ok - this is just ludicrous.  The <a href="http://www.willcountyillinois.com/">Will County</a> Board wants to adjust state laws so inmates can be forced to pay back their stay in jail.  Sure... We incarcerate the poorest among us, then when we turn them loose no better than they came in, we force them to pay us back.  "Well, they're getting cable TV and whatnot... Why not?"</p>

<p>Because we don't kick a man when he's down.  We're better than that... Or I thought we were.</p>
