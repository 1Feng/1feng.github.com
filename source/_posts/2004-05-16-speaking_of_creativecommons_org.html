I've been meaning to do this, and my article on <a href="http://www.lessig.org">Lessig.org</a> just reminded me again.  I've now licensed this site under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">Creative Commons Attribute / Non-Commercial / Share Alike</a> license.  Essentially, do what you like with this content so long as I get credit as its originator and you're not making anything off of it.  Hey, I'm not getting paid to write this stuff either! :)</p>
