title: Ugh...
---
<p>So I'm driving along the highway last night, coming home from eating out, and "thump, thump, thump, thump."  Tire's gone flat on the highway.  The up side is that I was a half mile of getting on an interchange where I would have been doing 55 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr> through a corner; it could have blown there and caused all kinds of fun.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm heading to the tire shop this morning to get at least one new tires.  It's times for some new ones - these have 50k miles on them - so I might just get a completely new set.</p>
