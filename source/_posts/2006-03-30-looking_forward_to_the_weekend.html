title: Looking forward to the weekend
---
<p>I can't believe it's almost Friday.  I've had some awesome rides this week, and am hoping for more of the same this weekend in El Paso.  I'm headed over to the <a href="http://www.the-bicycle-company.com/Coyote.html">Coyote Classic</a> in my ol' stomping grounds in the <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/franklin/">Franklin Mountain State Park</a>.  Everything I've heard so far is that the XC course is really knarly now - I can't wait. </p>

<p>I did two days of climbing this week.  Between the two, I got in 5k of climbing including the <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/ride-maps/Sunrise+Climb.jpg.html">Sunrise climb</a> (1k vertical feet up in under 2 miles) on my <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/bike-harem/standing-strong-bullit.jpg.html">Bullit</a>.  There was a wind at my back, but just the same it is 41 pounds of bike.  I felt so good the whole climb.  A few sections I was actually surprised to look down and see how low my HR was!  Then, there's the descent.  I swear that the Sunrise descent into Hidden Hills is one of the most fun decents I can think of.  Since it was a weekday, there were only a few hikers on the mile and a half descent.  It qualifies for my newly created Perma-Grin Trail Award.  Sweet, sweet stuff...</p>

<p>Anyhow, my goal for this weekend is to put in a solid performance.  This'll be my first <abbr title="Cross Country">XC</abbr> race of the year, so I don't quite know what to expect out of my body.  Based on last week's race, this should be right at the limit of race-pace riding that starts to get to me, so I should feel strong for the whole race.  With as much racing as I have planned over the next month, I'm shooting to have enough in me for another short loop (8 miles) if not the whole 28 mile course again, but I still want to keep a good pace.  It's a fine balance between giving just enough and leaving it all out on the course and I'm still working on finding that for my body.  In the <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org">NMORS</a> the Expert 19 - 29 category is lumped in with the pros, so this'll be a points race for me, not a podium finish race.</p>
