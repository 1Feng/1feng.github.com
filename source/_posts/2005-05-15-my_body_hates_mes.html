title: My body hates mes
---
<p>Today, all day - except while I took a nap - my body has been screaming at me.  It's acting like a toddler who isn't getting the toy they want at Toys 'R' Us.  I can't really blame it, yesterday was a torture-a-thon.</p>

<p>Started out a bit early for me on a Saturday.  At 7 I was up and getting ready to go to the <a href="http://www.earthriders.com/trails/trail.php?s=mo&amp;file=smithville.xml">Smithville Trails</a> for some trail work.  This week, <a href="http://www.earthriders.com/">Earthriders</a> is having their monthly meeting up there, so we're in the process of sprucing the trails up for everyone.  One of the things that I've been wanting to do is build a solid rock trail crossing on one of the places that constantly has water issues.  With the help of my Dad, I just about got it in yesterday...  He's amazingly helpful when the alternative is helping my Mom clean out the garage :D</p>

<p>Spending half a day positioning 50 - 100 pound rocks is enough for anybody, but not me.  I followed this up with a 2 hour <a href="http://www.acmebicyclecompany.com/tourdecowtown.htm">alley cat race</a>.  I managed to stay out of the top ten (mainly because 5 of the restaurants I stopped at for take-out menus didn't have any, but I'm not bitter!) in the race, and managed to pull the slowest time in the time trial.  Note to self: work on balancing things on your back and handlebars before the next alley cat.  What can I say, though?  I have a string of last place finishes I needed to defend :)</p>

<p>If you're interested, I have some <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat">pictures up on MeAndTravis</a>.  A few local blogger/cyclists were represented: <a href="http://staubio.blogspot.com/">Stuabio</a> <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat/DSC04743">tries to look mean</a>, and <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/infocities/blogs/index.php?blog=26">Vlad</a> <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat/DSC04733">pulls off the mean look</a>, and I look goofy <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat/DSC04853">trying to ride a chopper</a>.  And of course, what race would be complete without some <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat/DSC04840">road rash</a>?</p>

<p>If that wasn't enough punishment for my body, I headed out to a wedding reception 'til 1.  No biggie, except I'm normally be bed by 11 (I'm a barrel of monkey's worth of fun, really!).  So now my body's screaming at me.  Hopefully it'll be better by tomorrow.  I'll be <a href="http://www.marc.org/bcc/">commuting by bike</a> in to work, so if nothing else I'll give it a few more reasons to be pissed.</p>

<p>Porn update: I'm now numero uno in Google's mind when it comes to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=lake%20of%20the%20ozarks%20porn">lake of the ozarks porn</a>.  I got a few more visitors over the weekend.</p>
