title: Shout out to Dave Wilson, Short Track National Champion!
---
<p>Just heard from Dave - he took the national championship for Expert 30+ short track today!  The same guys that attacked him yesterday tried to control the race early on.  He had to chase back in, but once he got back in the lead group he controlled the race.  There's one more semi-pro racing in New Mexico now.</p>
