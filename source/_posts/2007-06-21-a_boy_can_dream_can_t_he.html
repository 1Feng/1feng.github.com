title: A boy can dream... can't he?

<p><a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a> has decided on namespacing all of their future code.  Hooray!  That means that new PEAR2 code will get along nicely with my code even though we might both have a Testing_Selenium object since theirs will now be PEAR2_Testing_Selenium, and mine is Domain51_Testing_Selenium.  But what if it went further?</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be an amazing triumph of an open source community if all of the different camps came together now and started creating standard interfaces in the main namespace?  Imagine being able to rely on an object that implements HTTP_Request being the same from PEAR2 to Zend to Solar to EZ to Domain51 and Timbucktwo.  It would be an <abbr title="object oriented">OO</abbr> utopia...</p>

<p>Now if a sage programmer I know wasn't so sage...  but he's right.  It's not work the effort of herding cats for what little - if anything - you'd get out of it.  At least there's dreaming...</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: It should be noted that the assumption of PEAR2_ is based on looking at what's happening in the new <a href="http://svn.pear.php.net/repo/">PEAR repository</a> and piecing together conversations on the mailing list.  Greg's right, nothing's official yet, but let's keep our fingers crossed...</p>
