title: Think fast thoughts
---
<p>Yikes it's early...  I need everyone to think <em>fast</em> thoughts for me today.  I'll be racing in my first "short" (only an hour and a half) mountain bike <a href="http://www.midwestfattireseries.com/05schedule/3Tick.html">race</a> in nearly a year and a half - and doing it in Expert no less.</p>

<p>I'll report back once I get back in town...</p>
