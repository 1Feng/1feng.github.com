title: XFN - the latest evolution in Friendster?
---
<p><em>Warning: Programming-speak stuff coming up</em></p>

<p>During my morning reading, I came across <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/">Paul M. Jones'</a> <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/?p=133">post</a> on the Semantic Web.  This guy always has good thoughts if you're a programmer.  Anyway, the <a href="http://theryanking.com/blog/archives/2005/04/07/an-evolutionary-revolution/">article he linked to</a> had some interesting thoughts on building micro-content, but things didn't get good until I started looking through <a href="http://theryanking.com/blog/">Ryan's</a> references.</p>

<p>A few clicks later - 2 degrees of seperation away - I came across <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN - XHTML Friends Network</a>.  In a nutshell, you adjust the links in your <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=define%3Ablogroll">blogroll</a> to include a <code>rel</code> attribute that denotes if someone is a <em>friend</em>, <em>co-worker</em>, <em>neighbor</em>, <em>spouse</em>, someone you've <em>met</em>, etc. (the full list of associations is available on <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/join">XFN: Getting Started</a>).</p>

<p>Of course, with a blog software that knew of XFN, you would just be hitting checkboxes saying that you've met this person or that and consider them a friend or an acquaintance.  Then a search engine comes along, sees all of these links, and files them away as people you know with the various relationships you've set.  When someone goes to a search engine and searches for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22">Travis Swicegood</a>" they not only find my site (because I've linked to myself as <em>me</em>), but they also are presented with links to view all of my co-workers, or neighbors, or friends, or people I've met, etc., etc.  It's basically Friendster or Orkut let loose on the web.</p>

<p>Of course, I imagine this doesn't sound all that exciting to my normal readership, but I know there are a few programmer-types who read the site from time to time.  I think through this practical example, they'll see how big of a deal <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormats">microformats</a> could potentially be.</p>
