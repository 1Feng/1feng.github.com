<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft's technology evangelist is offering "friendly" suggestions to Mozilla open source browser groups and calling for more discussion about how the two sides can benefit from upcoming enhancements in Longhorn, the next version of Windows.</p></blockquote>

It appears Microsoft is trying to make nice with the folks over at Mozilla.  Could it just be a wolf in sheeps clothing?  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> represents a real threat to Internet Explorer.  Maybe by bringing the enemy into the same camp they can attempt play the ol' "why go to a 3rd-party when we're the source" argument.</p>

<p>
It'll be interesting to see how this develops.</p>
