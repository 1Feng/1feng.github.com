title: Tuning SugarCRM Database Instances
---
<p>Nothing like <a href="http://developers.sugarcrm.com/wordpress/2008/03/17/next-sdug-webinar-database-tuning-tips-on-march-19th/">a post</a> from the co-founder of your company to remind you that you're giving a presentation in a few days and need to get some slides done.  Oops...  :-)</p>

<p>I'll be giving a talk titled <a href="http://www.sugarforge.org/content/community/user-groups/register.php?event_id=21">Tuning Sugar Databases</a>.  It's free and open to anyone with 45 minutes or so of time Wednesday at 10 AM <abbr title="Pacific Daylight savings Time">PDT</abbr>.  It is focused on <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/">SugarCRM</a> and its interaction with MySQL, but a lot of the content is of general interest to anyone wanting to tune MySQL.</p>
