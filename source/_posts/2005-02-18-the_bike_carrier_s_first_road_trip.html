title: The bike carrier's first road trip
---
<p>There won't be any rainy-day Sunday posts this weekend although it is supposed to be raining - or is it supposed to snow now?  Anyway, I'll be in the Ozarks getting wet and building mountain bike trails with <a href="http://www.earthriders.org/">EarthRiders</a>.  This weekend is part of getting a $70k grant towards trail building equipment, so soaked or not, I want to help 'em get it lined up.  Hopefully we'll get a lot of new trail put in this weekend.</p>

<p>So since I won't be here to provoke your thoughts all weekend long, I'll come up with a discussion topic: <em>The validity of low-rise (aka rapid-rise) rear derailluers.  Are they as good as advertised or a marketing ploy?</em>  Talk amongst yourselves...</p>
