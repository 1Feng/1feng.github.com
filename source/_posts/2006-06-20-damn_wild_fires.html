<blockquote><p>Flagstaff, AZ - As fire danger increases across the Southwest the Coconino National Forest will close to public access and use Friday, morning, June 23 at 8:00 a.m..</p>

<p>Effective Friday, the Coconino National Forest will close to public access. Conditions have warranted closure of the entire national forest. Closures in the past have proven to be an effective means of reducing the number of human-caused fires.</p></blockquote>
