title: Lobbying fees not disclosed in Missouri
---
<p><a href="http://www.bluntwatch.info">Blunt Watch</a> has <a href="http://bluntwatch.info/archives/2005/01/12/million-dollar-inauguration/">a post</a> about the special lobbyist-only inauguration party, something jumped out at me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Since Missouri <em>doesn?t require the disclosure of lobbying fees</em> we might never know how much the Blunt family will make off the affair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.  Does that seem right?  If I got elected to office, you could pay <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/">my sister</a> a million dollars a year to lobby for your cause with the implication that her lobbying would involve calling me up and saying "brother, you should support this".  That's not right...</p>

<p>I'm still formulating my thoughts on this, but I think we need to push for a change in the lobbying laws in Missouri.  If you want election reform, how about publishing in real-time whose paying whom to speak for what.  The only way any politician could oppose such a seemingly obvious change in the rules would be because they've got some dirty laundry that might be aired, such as a sibling or other family member getting paid to lobby them.  Seems like one of the things I've heard/read about Blunt over the last few days is that he plans to make government more efficient and <em>transparent</em>.  What's more transparent than publishing in real-time who is "Them that's got the gold"?</p>
