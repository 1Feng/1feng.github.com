title: Experimenting with speed
---
<p>For the last three days, I've been experimenting with speed with some great results that I wanted to share here.  </p>

<p>Talk about a lead in.  :)  No, it's not <em>that</em> kind of speed, but my car's speed.  I've been driving the speed limit in to and back home from work.  Since I am the slowest car on the road, I can set my cruise and go to town - literally.  Coming in to work today with a bike on top of my car, I got nearly 40 mpg!</p>

<p>It's interesting how many cars speed.  I was passed by two school buses this morning while I was driving the speed limit.  School buses people!  When our school buses don't pay any attention to laws, what has the world come to?</p>

<p>Oh, and as far as time...  I think it might take me a minute or two longer by dropping the extra 4 - 6 mph.  For that extra two minutes, I'm gaining more than 10% in fuel efficiency.  So do your part, try to plan your drives so you can do the speed limit.  It'll save you money and piss off everyone else on the road! :)</p>
