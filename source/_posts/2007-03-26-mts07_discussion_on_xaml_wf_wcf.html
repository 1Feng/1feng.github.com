title: MTS07 - Discussion on XAML/WF/WCF
---
<p>Don Box and Chris Anderson.  Don used to be a specialist in HST - Hooking Shit Together.  They started off just asking for questions from the attendees on "how [Microsoft] sucks?" and they'd answer 'em.</p>

<p>Best quote: IE7... Civil Rights... It's all the same... </p>

<p>From the gallery about IE7 - we avoid that which Department of Homeland Security recommends against.  Don's response... "yeah... like civil liberties."</p>

<p>We got an apology from Box for all of the statements that Ballmer makes that scares people. :-)</p>

<p>XAML is for writing shit down - WSD.</p>

<p>"The best thing that happened to Microsoft this decade was Google." from Don.  "Microsoft works best when it has a big, scary competitor."</p>

<p>Talking about MS not being cool and people not wanting to go to work for them now.  Chris said he thinks MS needs a better apprenticeship program.  Ironic that he mentioned that based on my recent thoughts on how there needs to be more craft-style apprenticeships in the dev industry in general to teach the parts of programming that don't come from books.</p>
