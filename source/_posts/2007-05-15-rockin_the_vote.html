title: Rockin' the vote
---
<p>A quick thanks to everyone who's <a href="http://support.activestate.com/komodo-xpi-ext-vote">voted</a> for me in the last few days.  Emails and a strategically placed phone call or two have really helped.  If you haven't voted yet, the polls are still open through today (Tuesday).  Remember, straight ticket voting is best ;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://support.activestate.com/komodo-xpi-ext-vote">Extension Category</a> - vote for MySQL Console by tswicegood<br />
<a href="http://support.activestate.com/komodo-toolbox-ext-vote">Toolbox Category</a> - vote for MySQL Shortcuts by tswicegood</p>

<p>You do have to register to vote.  On other of those pages there should be a "register" link, just fill out the info and for your primary language - if you're one of my none-programming readers - choose PHP.</p>

<p>Exit polling (aka the live results they're posting on the site) have a good feel to 'em now.</p>

<p>In other news, I swear there's about to be a <a href="http://www.redlinebicycles.com/adultbikes/monocog-29er.html">bike</a> <a href="http://www.redlinebicycles.com/adultbikes/monocog-flight-29er.html">post</a> on here...  I do still ride them... sometimes :-)</p>
