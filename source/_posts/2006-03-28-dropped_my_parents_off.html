title: Dropped my parents off
---
<p>I dropped my <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com">parents</a> off a little over an hour ago for their plane trip back to KC.  They came and hung out at the race on Friday with me and got to see me win.  Definitely a cool bonus.  My mom also added her style to my place helping me get it in a bit better looking shape.</p>

<p>So now I've got to work out who'll go on "vacation" with me next time (read: help me at the next enduro race).</p>
