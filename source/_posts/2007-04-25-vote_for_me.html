title: Vote for me...
---
<p>Have you ever wanted to give something back to the (not-so) humble author of this site?  Well, now's your chance.  Go <a href="http://support.activestate.com/komodo-xpi-ext-vote">vote for me</a> - the "MySQL Console by tswicegood" over at the Komodo Extensibility Challenge.  That's for the <a href="http://support.activestate.com/komodo-xpi-ext-vote">extension</a> category.  I also have two entries in the <a href="http://support.activestate.com/komodo-toolbox-ext-vote">toolbox</a> category (hint: I voted for the MySQL Shortcuts).  Here's the links for the various packages:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://support.activestate.com/forum-topic/mysql-console">MySQL Console</a></li>
<li><a href="http://support.activestate.com/forum-topic/mysql-shortcuts">MySQL Shortcuts</a></li>
<li><a href="http://support.activestate.com/forum-topic/php-toolbox">PHP Toolbox</a></li></ul>

<p>Remember, vote early, vote often ;-)</p>

<p>P.S.  ActiveState guys - that's a joke.  I'm not advocating any <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/archives/cat_vote_fraud.html">Ohio-style voting</a>.</p>
