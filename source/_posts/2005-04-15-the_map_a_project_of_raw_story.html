<p>Ya know... Normally I wouldn't pay close attention to this sort of thing.  I consider it no more than an attempt to help reinforce your world view of the "other" side as being even.  Both Democrats and Republicans do this...  </p>

<p>But, here's a <a href="http://rawstory.com/exclusives/map_conservative_ties_raw_story_415.htm">map of conservative ties</a> around the country.  What caught my attention is the yellow block in the far bottom right corner.  It's the Tigua's!  That's the "Indian" - as in I'm an Indian god-damnit! - from El Paso.  It's not surprising that they have ties to the Republican party though.  The Republicans are in power in Texas, and they're dying to get back on the gambling band-wagon.  You grease whoever's palms you need to when you're talking that kind of money.  At least if you <em>are</em> in the "I'm an Indian god-damnit!" category of folk.</p>
