title: Terry Chay isn't into orgies...
---
<p>So yesterday I'm listening to <a href="http://podcast.phparch.com/main/index.php/episodes:20071018">Ramblecast 2.0</a> when I did whatever the audio version of a double-take is.  No, it wasn't the garbled noise and the "what the ----?!  Guys!  There's a laptop here!!".  Nor was it Sara's <em>Yahoo!'ing</em> in the background (I wonder if that's in her contract - she has to do that every time someone mentions the company?).  No, it was when someone mentioned <a href="http://terrychay.com/">Terry Chay's</a> <a href="http://works.phparch.com/c/schedule/talk/d2s5/2">Internet is an Ogre</a> talk.  Not the <em>e</em>.  Ogre, as in monster, Shrek, big green smelly thing.</p>

<p>I don't know how many times I'd seen that topic listed by various people online, and every - I mean absolutely <strong>every</strong> time I read it - my mind transmuted it into <em>orgy</em>.  Seriously.  I hadn't read the description of his talk, hadn't attended it, and until yesterday had never heard anyone call it by its name.</p>

<p>I even had the whole idea of the talk worked out.  Web 2.0's all about sharing everything with everyone and right now everyone's getting a little dirty.  It made sense to me.  Looks like <a href="http://terrychay.com/blog/article/zendcon-talk-lunch20.shtml#comment-194212">I wasn't the only one</a> to make that mistake.</p>
