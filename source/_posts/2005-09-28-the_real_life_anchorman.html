title: The real life anchorman
---
<p>Ok... so I'm checking my email, watching the morning news in my hotel room in Phoenix, and the anchor guy on <a href="http://www.fox10.com/morning/index.shtml">Fox morning</a> show says, "It's Wednesday and I'm Jen..." and goes through the whole thing.  Jen, his partner is trying not to laugh before he realizes what he's done.  His response, "What?  That's what it said..."</p>

<p>Once I get back in town, I'll post pictures and more about the trip.</p>
