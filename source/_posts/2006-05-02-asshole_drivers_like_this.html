<p>I should feel sorry for the guy, but I can't help but think he's just an asshole:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Quote from <a href="http://parkrecord.com/county/ci_3764043">DelRay Hatch</a>:</em><br />
After declaring Wednesday that cyclists should be taxed to use roads, Oakley City Councilman DelRay Hatch said, "so the ones that don't pay I could run over."</p></blockquote>

<p>This after <a href="http://epicriding.blogspot.com/2006/03/at-loss.html">Bill Corliss</a> was killed while riding his road bike just over a month ago.  That comment is disgraceful, and the ignorance that lead to it is the same ignorance that makes it <a href="">dangerous to ride a bike</a> in the city.  Where there are more people, you're more likely to run into people who think that cyclists don't "pay their fair [share]".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no direct contact information for Mr. Hatch, but there is an email address for general <a href="http://www.oakleycity.com/city/oakleycity.htm">Oakley City</a> contact: <a href="mailto:oakley@allwest.net?subject=I am appalled with Councilman Hatch's comments">oakley@allwest.net</a>.  If you're the letter writing type, I'd encourage you to shoot 'em an email.</p>
