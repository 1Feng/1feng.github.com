title: Celebrity spam...

<p><a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/01/16/my_response_to_rick_mathes">This post</a> is one of the posts I get the most comments to and searches for.  Seriously, every day I get anywhere from 6 to 30 people coming from Google searching for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=Rick%20Mathes">Rick Mathes</a>".</p>

<p>Anyhow, I got some <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/01/16/my_response_to_rick_mathes#c7432">celebrity spam</a> last night.  This guy is a piece of work.  He really is.  I like the closing to <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/01/16/my_response_to_rick_mathes#c7434">my response</a>.  I know the guy won't respond.  He doesn't believe in dialog, because then he has to entertain the idea that he might not have the corner on god's own thoughts, but just the same.  I hope all this back and forth will provide some light to someone.  Here's to spirituality.</p>
