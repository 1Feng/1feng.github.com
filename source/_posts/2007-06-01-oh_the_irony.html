<p>Oh... the irony.  A talking cow at the entrance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_graham">Billy Graham's</a> new <a href="http://www.billygraham.org/BGLibrary_Index.asp">library</a>?  Talk about ballsy...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2032&amp;version=9;">Exodus 32:4 - <abbr title="Kings James Version">KJV</abbr></a></p>
<blockquote><p>And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now the question is: is he Moses, or Aaron?</p>
