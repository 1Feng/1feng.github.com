title: Presidential hopeful - I think not.
---
<p>For those of you who don't know me that well, <a href="http://www.votetwiceforswice.com">Vote Twice for Swice</a> isn't a legitimate attempt to win the Presidency.  Instead, it's an experiment in <em>political wikis</em>.  There are two protected pages that only I can edit, everything else is up for grabs.  Being a wiki, it is entirely possible that various portions will be changed by myself or others, but the idea is to create a <em>Centrist Presidential Platform</em> and bring awareness to one of the potential flaws of electronic voting that can be addressed if the politicians make it happen - the write-in vote.</p>

<p>I see the possibility for the quick and hasty embrace of electronic voting machines post Election 2000 in the name of making sure "every vote counts".  What happens when the write-in vote isn't an option any longer because touch screens without that option have replaced them?  What happens when someone like myself, outside the political - well, possibly even the regular - mainstream decide to launch a grassroots attempt for any seat?  If I can't get my name on the ballot because of time restraints or the lack of financing to mobilize a state-wide/nation-wide signature campaign I am effectively blocked from entering the race.  Thus the two parties, in their quick embrace of technology to fix a problem have fixed the method for getting into an election.</p>

<p>Electronic voting is the answer - we need a fast, accurate voting machine that can provide immediate feedback to the voter to insure that their vote is cast for the candidate that they wanted it cast for.  Write-in votes can still be a part of this equation.  The last few years have seen character recognition software (<abbr title="Character Recognition Software">CRS</abbr>) become extremely powerful.  Voters could be presented with the ballot, with one extra place to select for write-in votes.  Once there, they are given a box in which to print the name of the person they wish to vote for.  The written name is run through a CRS program and displayed back to the user for them to verify.  At this time, they can make any adjustments necessary by selecting a character and using the on-screen keyboard.  Thus preserves the "write-in" vote, and still provides a means of privately checking to make sure it is recorded correctly.</p>

<p>So is a <em>Vote (once or twice) for Swice</em> a wasted vote?  Both parties are so essentially the same that a vote for a change might be your best bet.  Visit <a href="http://www.votetwiceforswice.com">Vote Twice for Swice</a> and help create the platform that if elected I will uphold.  Once that's in place, then decide if it's a waste to flip a coin to decide who you vote for, or to vote for something and someone that stands for something different.</p>
