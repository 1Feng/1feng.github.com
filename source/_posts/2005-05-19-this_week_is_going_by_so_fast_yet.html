title: This week is going by so fast, yet...

<p>... so slow.  Every day this week it seems like I haven't had enough time to get anything done, but I can't believe it's only Thursday.  Seems like it should be Saturday or Sunday already!  This is some sort of wierd time warp thing.  </p>

<p>Man, see how much having a car screws you up?  When you <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/05/16/first_day_going_to_work_by_bike">quit using your car</a> for just a few days, the whole week is thrown into disarray.</p>
