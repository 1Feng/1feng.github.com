<p>My dad's father - or as he called him, the <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/index.php?title=the_old_man_is_gone&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">Old Man</a> - passed away last night.  It's clich&eacute; at this point to say that I felt like I never knew him.  I think that's the standard thing at this point for any grandchild to say.  In this case, I think it's more fitting.</p>

<p>I haven't seen or talked to him - or any of my dad's family for that matter - for over a decade.  Before that, I had only seem him occasionally after I was 6 and my family moved out west.  There was a rift in the family, the details of which I won't bore you with, but it ended with folks basically going their own separate ways.</p>

<p>It's kind of a mixed bag.  I don't really feel a sense of loss because like I said I hardly knew him and he hasn't played any part in my life for over a decade, but I feel for my <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/">Dad</a> because he's got to go through this.  If you have a chance, I'm sure he'd <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com/index.php?title=the_old_man_is_gone&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1#comments">appreciate a comment</a>.</p>

<p>Anyhow, off to finish packing for <a href="http://dawntilduskrace.com/">tomorrow's race</a>.  There was snow on the ground here this morning and the chance of it all day today in Gallup, but it's supposed to be in the 60s tomorrow.  I've been fighting some sort of stomach bug all week, so I'm not looking for a stellar performance, but hopefully it's enough to have a respectable placing tomorrow around 7 PM.  Hopefully this year I won't end up solo'ing the second half of the day :-)</p>
