title: "Lessig on McCain on Tech: A must watch"

<p>Imagine having a phone service that only called other members.  Like Verizon's <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/splash/innetwork.jsp">IN network</a>, except you can't get <em>out</em> of the network.  That's what some of the companies that provide the bandwidth behind the Internet would like to see the Internet become.  A place where they control who sees what.</p>

<blockquote><p>Want to go to Yahoo?  That's only $5 a month.  Google?  Well, that's $25 a month.  Oh, what's that?  You want to go to the sites you find on Google?  Well, that's an extra $75.  Oh, and here's our email client for you to check your email.  No, you can't use your own client...</p></blockquote>

<p>That's the kind of sales pitch you could get when signing up for Internet service in the future if "net-neutrality" is not defended.  It's an Internet that resembles AOL in the early 90s.  <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/cbcd3a48-4b0e-4864-8be1-d04561c132ea.htm">John McCain doesn't believe in net-neutrality</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When Regulation Is Warranted, John McCain Acts. John McCain does not believe in prescriptive regulation like &laquo;net-neutrality&raquo;...</p></blockquote>

<p>That's taken directly from his <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/cbcd3a48-4b0e-4864-8be1-d04561c132ea.htm">Technology Policies</a>.  Feel free to verify for yourself.</p>

<p>I could go on, but <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a> (who's site happens to be down right now) did an <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/08/me_on_mccain_on_technology.html">excellent video</a> reviewing McCain's technology platform, so I'll let him do the speaking.</p>
