title: My very own Swicegood troll!
---
<p>Well whatdaya know - I have my very own Swicegood troll!  I'm not on great terms with my Dad's family, and guess what - one of 'em found it worthwhile after a decade without seeing or speaking to me to <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/01/04/abu_musab_al_zarqawi_reportedly_arrested#c144">leave a comment</a>!  Now, brace yourself...  This is a fourth grade teacher whose responsibility it is to impart basic knowledge to Charlotte's fourth graders.  This is a wonderful example of how to use punctuation.</p>

<blockquote><p> Do you not have anything better to do????????</p>

<p>How sad. Get a real job!!!</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, I just learned something.  Instead of making your point with words, 8 question marks can do the job.  I wish I would have known that, it would save me from being so verbose.  I wonder how you convey that many question marks in conversation though.  Hmm...</p>

<p>If you would like to ask for yourself, please feel free to drop Tracie (aka t. swicegood - the shift button apparently only works for question and exclamation marks, not those things like last names) a line at work - where she logged on from oddly enough.  I guess it's just me, but I find it ironic that she'd leave the comment complaining that I should "get a real job" while she's surfing at her office.  Hmm... I wonder what <a href="mailto:pineygroveelem@cms.k12.nc.us">Principal Flamer</a> would say to that obvious misuse of city property.  But I digress.  Send all correspondence to:</p>

<blockquote><p>Tracie Swicegood, Room 303<br />
c/o Piney Grove School<br />
8801 Eaglewood drive<br />
Charlotte, NC  28212</p></blockquote>
