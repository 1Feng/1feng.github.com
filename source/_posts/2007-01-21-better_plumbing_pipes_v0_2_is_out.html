title: Better Plumbing... Pipes v0.2 is out
---
<p>Two weeks and two releases.  I'm on a roll. :-)</p>

<p>I just released <a href="http://phpinpipes.org/">Pipes</a> v0.2 which is available from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phpinpipes/">Pipes project page</a> on Google Code.  Notable new features:</p>

<ul><li>AJAX! - and no Francios, I'm not renaming Pipes now... ;-)</li>
<li>Integration with <a href="http://mootools.net/">Mootools</a> to provide the AJAX and some basic effects</li>
<li>You can browse by tags which brings tag support up a notch</li>
<li>New model finders: these allow you to encapsulate finding logic into objects that can then be used by all model mappers</li>
<li>The default HTML page is now based on the <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/Articles/17/">CSS Framework</a></li>
<li>Did I mention AJAX support?</li></ul>

<p>Yesterday I put together a new site for <a href="http://phpinpipes.org">Pipes</a>.  It shows some of the eye candy (hint: hover your mouse over words that have dots under them) and the new logo/slogan.  I owe a big thanks to <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/">my sister</a> for keeping me from using some marketing-y slogan and keeping it simple and funny.  <a href="http://phpinpipes.org/"><em>Pipes - Better Plumbing</em></a>.  </p>

<p>A big thanks also to a former colleague and buddy who's been critiquing ideas since Pipes was just a thought in my head <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh Eichorn</a>.  He's helped out big time with this release by allowing me to play 20 questions on AJAX and JavaScript while I figured out exactly what I needed/wanted to do to get AJAX into Pipes.</p>

<p>Now that Pipes is in a pretty much usable state (even though it lacks the kind of documentation I want for it), I've got a few pet projects I'm going to work on and see how they turn out.  You'll see links here if anything comes of them.</p>
