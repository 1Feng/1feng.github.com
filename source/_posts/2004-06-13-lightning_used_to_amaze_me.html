title: Lightning used to amaze me
---
<p>Lightning used to amaze me.  I used to sit in awe of the abrupt, raw power that it generates.  It still makes me take notice, but it doesn't amaze me anymore.  What amazes me is a cyclist.  How they can go for hours on end, and push themselves to their body's end, and still find that extra 50 watts of power for the final sprint they didn't know they had.  How they can ride a tempo pace up a hill and go 'til their legs are about to explode, only to find one final burst of energy and ten more feet to keep everyone else behind them as they crest the hill first.</p>

<p>No... Lightning does what it does as it's supposed.  The cyclist, they do what they're not supposed to out of sheer will.  And until I can ride no more, I hope to always be able to call myself... <strong>a cyclist</strong>.</p>
