<p>I've <a href="http://epicriding.blogspot.com/2007/01/its-killing-me.html#116958169424243266">been</a> <a href="http://mcturge.blogspot.com/2007/01/for-smiling-on-cloudy-day.html#c301724297617899069">talking</a> up this <a href="http://mbaa.net/racing/race1.html">weekend's races</a> down in Fountain Hills and I'm seriously considering the Marathon now.</p>

<p>44 miles of some of the sweetest 29'er trails in Arizona...  It's a super fast course with a great flow.  I haven't gotten any good distance riding in a while, so this might just be the kick start my year needs.  If only I knew for sure that they were doing 5 Marathons this year and I'm not shooting myself in the foot for points in the XC.</p>
