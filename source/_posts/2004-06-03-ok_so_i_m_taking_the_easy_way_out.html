title: Ok, so I'm taking the easy way out
---
<p>I know... I know... Nothing really original in a few days, but I have a good reason.</p>

<p>The last few days have been hectic.  By the time I get through with work, all I want to do is unwind.  This creative writing bit is actually helping out.  It's nice to immerse your mind in something totally different for a little while.  Unfortunately, the last two days my mind was totally immersed in problems...</p>

<p>Two days ago, my Internet connection went down about 4:30 in the afternoon.  I finished up, discussed a few things, and headed home pretty sure I'd be able to get it up and running first thing in the morning the next day.  Yesterday (the next day) at 3 PM, I finally got my Internet connection back up.  With most of the day gone, I spent the rest of the afternoon getting everything in order: checking on the server, trying to make sure nothing earth shattering was in my Inbox, just the miscellaneous things that you keep tabs on throughout the day.</p>

<p>Today, started out much better.  Right as I got into my morning stretch to really get some major programming out of the way, my IMAP server went down.  One of the joys that goes with a dedicated server, if something goes wrong you get to call yourself.  Well, the tech support at me, myself, and I wasn't able to get it back up and running right away.  I actually left work this afternoon still not having it back up.  After I got home, a quick check of the few messages I had left on different forums finally yielded something, and I got my email back up about 6 PM this evening.</p>

<p>So... here's to tomorrow.  May Friday be productive so something gets done this week...</p>
