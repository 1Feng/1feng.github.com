title: SugarCRM's hiring
---
<p>To add to the recent chorus of "we're hiring!" posts on <a href="http://planet-php.org">Planet PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/">SugarCRM</a> is looking for a few good people.  Well, a few dozen actually.  They aren't all programming jobs, but we do have a few PHP developer spots open.</p>

<p>If you're looking for work or a new gig and want to work on one of the PHP-land's flagship open source packages (we're even <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/gplv3-faq.html">GPLv3</a> now), shoot me an email at tswicegood [at] sugarcrm.com and I'll put you in touch with the right people.</p>
