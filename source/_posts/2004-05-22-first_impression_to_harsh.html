title: First impression to harsh?
---
<p>
Ok, I admit it.  My first impressions of <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lessig's</a> <a href="http://free-culture.org/">Free Culture</a> might have been a bit rough.  He is very thorough in his explanations, but the thoroughness is warranted.  I am through the first of four main parts, and am eagerly reading the rest of the book.  More updates to come...</p>
