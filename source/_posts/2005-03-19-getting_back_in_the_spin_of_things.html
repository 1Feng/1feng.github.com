title: Getting back in the spin of things
---
<p>Think good thoughts for me today... I'll be punishing myself for <a href="http://www.heartlandrace.com/spoke.htm">6 hours</a> today in a mountain bike race.  What a "welcome back" race, huh?  No racing to for nearly a year and a half to a 6 hour sufferfest.  What a way to jump back on the horse - or bike.</p>

<p>Assuming I still have use of my arm muscles sometime this weekend, I'll post a review after I'm done...</p>
