<p>Haven't posted one of these in forever.  Well, it's been forever (or at least since the first of October) since I've uploaded my rides to <a href="http://tswicegood.motionbased.com/">MotionBased.com</a> and I'm catching up.  This was the a crazy ride back in October that I apparently didn't mention on my blog.  </p>

<p>Here's the quick stats: 26 miles, 5700' of climbing and decending, less than 4 hours of moving time with a 40 lbs bike, and oh yeah... I was out for nearly 9 hours!  (Long story short: one of the guys we were with took a nasty header - destroyed his helmet - had to be evacuated... did I mention it was 9 hours of riding?)</p>
