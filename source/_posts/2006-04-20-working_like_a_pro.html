<p><img class="imgRight" alt="Poor sug" src="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/d/5216-2/IMG_3268-sm.JPG" />You'd think I've spent a lot of time wrenching at a bike shop or something.  In less than twenty minutes I had stripped her down to her frame.  Tomorrow, she hits the road to <a href="http://www.fisherbikes.com/">Fisher HQ</a>.</p>

<p>Took the bike <a href="http://www.bicycleshowcase.com/">Bicycle Showcase</a> and was told they just need to send the frame off and they're certain <a href="http://www.fisherbikes.com/">Fisher</a> will warranty it.  The only kicker is just the turn around time.  I'll be lucky to get it back in time for <a href="http://teambigbear.com/event_detail.php?event_id=133">Southridge</a>, and it would be closing in on an act of God to get have it in time for Cloudcroft next weekend.  I know some people, so I'll try to call in a few favors, but I'm not holding my breath.</p>

<p>All the gory details are <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/bike-harem/sugar_293/">here</a>.  Warning, small children shouldn't view those pictures.  Just too disturbing.</p>
