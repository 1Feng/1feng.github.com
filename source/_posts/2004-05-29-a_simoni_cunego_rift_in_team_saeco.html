title: A Simoni - Cunego rift in Team Saeco?
---
<p>
After yesterday's stage win by Cunego, Simoni complained that his teammate had chased him down to force the field sprint at the end.  Sounds like Simoni might be a little spoiled.  Did he really think that Cunego would just let the 2nd place rider ride off?  It will be interesting to see how this develops before the Tour de France.</p>
