title: Call me an ass, but...
---
<p>I just closed <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/">MeAndTravis</a> (my old photo site) with a hard redirect to my new <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/">photo</a> site.  I was averaging 270 some unique visitors a day nearly 100% via hotlinking.  It seems some MySpace templater had taken a liking to a few of my photos and was using them as background images.  Not an issue, they're all <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">CC'd</a>, but they hotlinked them via the CSS document.  Anyhow, to all you anonymous MySpacers, sorry, but I like my bandwidth to stay mine.  Hopefully the broken pages will make people change their templates and drive the traffic back down to a reasonable pace.</p>

<p>I feel so tired today.  Last night's crits really took it out of me, and I didn't really go that hard that long.  I'm taking today off the bike, but I think I'm going to go out and play at MMP tomorrow afternoon to get my legs back under me.  I've been fidgety all day...  Remind me next year not to make my first mountain bike race of the year a national race.  What was I thinking?</p>

<p>It's just a tune up race...  It's just a tune up race... It's just a tune up race...</p>
