title: Are they listening?

<p>Whoa... I <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/09/01/the_perfect_php_editor">posted</a> a few days ago lamenting the fact that Komodo wasn't fully open-source, and what does <a href="http://www.activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> do?  They announce the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/openkomodo/">Open Komodo Project</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like Komodo IDE isn't going away, but with the Komodo platform open-source, it wouldn't be out of the question for someone to develop various open-source extension to whatever comes of the Open Komodo project that would replace the functionality in Komodo IDE.  The only thing I hope they pull out of the commercial version is the source control.  Having CVS/SVN access inside an open-source editor that is essentially Komodo IDE would be sweet.</p>
