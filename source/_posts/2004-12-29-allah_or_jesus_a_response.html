<fieldset><legend>Editor's Note</legend>Below is an email sent to <a href="mailto:MissionGateMinistry@MSN.com">Rick Mathes</a>.  He's the author of an Allah or Jesus article.  For commentary on the article and the full text, please <a href="http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/rickmathes.html">visit BreakTheChain.org's article</a>.  Feel free to copy this all, or in part, and <a href="mailto:MissionGateMinistry@MSN.com">email it to Rick</a> yourself.</fieldset>

<p>Mr. Mathes,</p>

<p>I just received an email this morning which I honestly thought was a fake.  Whenever I receive something like this, I run a few web searches to determine it's validity.  I was appalled to find that there was an actual minister with enough ignorance of world faiths to write something like this.</p>

<p>Just to make sure your "24 emails in favor of the article to 1 against" for your ignorant article on Islams stays somewhere about the same, I wanted to registered with you my displeasure in the article you wrote.</p>

<p>One section I would like you to particularly reflect on:</p>

<blockquote><p>I then said, ?Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Pat Robertson or Dr. Stanley ordering Protestants to do the same in order to go to heaven.?</p></blockquote>

<p>I ask you to look at the Crusades - was the ruthless massacre of Muslims not only ordered, but endorsed by the sitting pope?  And what about a certain Baptist minister in Kansas whose church's website touts the number of days that Matthew Shepard has been in hell?  Are both of these not examples of religions touting the killing of those contradictory to their faith?  And look to the Old Testament, is it not filled with "God's people" committing murder and sacking towns in the name of reclaiming what is theirs?</p>

<p>Quite honestly, I don't expect a response to this email.  The fact that you would not take the time to respond to BreakTheChain.org who was obviously trying to discredit you shows the extent of your convictions.  Just the same, I felt this needed to be said.</p>
