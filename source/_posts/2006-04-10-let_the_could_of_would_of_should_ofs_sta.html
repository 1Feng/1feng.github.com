title: Let the could of, would of, should ofs start
---
<p>Damn it, damn it, damn it.  My last lap time by my computer was 1:20 -  that was actual ride time.  My actual lap time: 1:33.  Second places last lap time: 1:41.  And how far out of second were we at the end of the day?  7 minutes!  Uggh!</p>

<p>Of course, it could also be said that my Spider and my late start cost the race.  My first lap racing time was 1:24, so was second's, but I had a three minute late start so my official time was 1:27.  My second lap ended up at 1:31 officially (1:30 and change of riding for me), and we were 13 minutes out of second at that point.  Assuming I would have put in a time around 1:15 on the 29'er, we would have been in second at that point.</p>

<p>Who knows, I could have hit the wall if I went out too fast on that last lap.  Being as spent as I was, I could have gotten sloppy and wrecked or flatted again... but still.  Damn it, damn it, damn it.</p>
