<p>I don't generally post my comments on other sites here, but I thought this one was worth sharing.  As seen (once approved anyway) on <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ryuukuro/88323.html?view=77315#t77315">ryuukuro: live</a>:</p>

<fieldset><legend>My Comments</legend>Wait a minute.  You mean the Bible changes its point of view?  And it's - gasp - vague!  Why, if I didn't know better I would say that you're saying the Word of God, which we all know is was written in stone on the first draft and has never been translated or altered in anyway, is relative to the situation...  Why that's sheer blasphemy!</fieldset>
