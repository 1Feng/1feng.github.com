title: I've got a lot more respect for swimmers
---
<p>This morning I thought it'd be fun to shake up the normal workout with some swimming.  Figured 30 - 45 minutes doing some laps at the <a href="http://www.flagstaffathleticclub.com/">local gym</a>.  Ouch...  My shoulders are going to be so sore tomorrow.  The pool at the east location (which I can see from my balcony) is only a half lap.  Going down and coming back the first few times though, I couldn't even make it back (was lacking something 10 feet).  After the turn around, for some reason I couldn't get enough air in.  I'm not used to having to take short deep breathes.  I think that's what was throwing me off.</p>

<p>I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCore-Performance-Endurance-Nutrition-Revolutionizes%2Fdp%2F1594863520%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1169583712%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Core Performance Endurance</a> yesterday.  A lot of the exercises look like new-age Pilates to me, which is great as that focuses on core (or in Pilate's lingo "trunk") strength and strengthening muscles without bulking up.  As <a href="http://soiledchamois.blogspot.com/">Mahokey</a> will attest, not many exercise/health/nutrition magazines or books or websites targeted toward men deal with anything but bulging biceps.  Anyhow, I'm going to start working up a strategy incorporate it into my training.  Once I've given it some time, I'll post up what my thoughts on it are.  <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/default.aspx">Dave</a> really liked the original and cites it as <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/archive/2007/01/01/2229.aspx">one of the things</a> that's made him the racer he is today.</p>

<p>I'm really starting to get excited about this weekend.  First race of the year and the first time I've been at a starting line since the end of August.  </p>
