title: Calling all mountain bike geeks
---
<p>One of my favorite sites online is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.  A repository of knowledge that's completely transparent, living, and breathing - free for all to use and contribute to; it appeals to the communal in me.</p>

<p>The other day I decided to see what Wikipedia had on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking">Mountain biking</a>, and particularly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mountain_bike_racing">racing</a>.  As you can see, not much.  They do have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mountain_bikers">65 mountain bikers</a> listed, but a large portion of those articles are incomplete or missing current information.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Haywood">Sue Haywood</a> didn't have her win at the 24 Hour Worlds listed until I added it the other day.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Brown_%28cyclist%29">Travis Brown</a> doesn't have anything listed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Brown_%28cyclist%29#Significant_results">results</a> listed for 2006, even though he won two marathons that I witnessed and managed a 3rd place in one while racing a single speed in the open/pro category.  That's just two that are missing results, not to mention the handful of other one's that I've come across.</p>

<p>So I'm making it a goal to go to the site whenever I have a chance and fix up some results, add info, basically try to adopt mountain biking on Wikipedia.  If you've got some spare time and have the slightest idea what a wiki is I could use some help... :-)</p>
