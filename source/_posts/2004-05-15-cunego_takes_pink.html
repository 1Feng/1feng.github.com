title: Cunego takes Pink
---
<p>
Italian and Simoni's Saeco teammate pulls off the win and pulls on the pink jersey at the top of stage 7.  Cunego covered every attack on the slopes of Montevergine, never helping anyone as they badgered Simoni all the way up.  Cunego was picked by many to win the stage today, but OLN's commentators had their doubts until they saw him cover each attack with ease.  Cunego is in his second Giro.  The youngest rider in the field last year's Giro, he is only "22.6" years old!  Figueras attacked every other kilometer it seemed, but in the end was unable to hold Cunego.
