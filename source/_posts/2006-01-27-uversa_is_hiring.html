title: Uversa is hiring
---
<p>I've been meaning to post this for awhile now, just keeps slipping my mind.  The company I work for, <a href="http://uversainc.com/">Uversa</a>, is looking to hire a few more PHP programmers.  The group of people we've got together are a riot to work with, so if you're looking for a new PHP programming gig, <a href="http://uversainc.com/site/contact/careers.html">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>One note, the online application link doesn't work.  If you're interested shoot an email to <em>careers@uversainc.com</em>.</p>
