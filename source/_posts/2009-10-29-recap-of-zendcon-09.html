title: Recap of ZendCon 09
---
<p>
Wow!  Has it already been nearly a week since <a href="http://zendcon.com/">ZendCon</a> wrapped up?!  Time is flying right now,
and with <a href="http://it-republik.de/php/phpconference09/"><abbr title="International PHP Conference">IPC</abbr></a> and the holidays right
around the corner, I don't see it getting any less hectic.
</p>
<p>
ZendCon was fun.  This was my first time attending/presenting this particular
conference.  It had a distinctly different feel too it than the conferences put
on by <a href="http://blog.tabini.ca/">Marco</a> and company.  ZC felt more
corporate than tek does, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  We tend to
forget that if it weren't for the business interests at play none of us would
have jobs.
</p>
<p>

I made it to only a handful of talks, but everything I attended was top-notch.
I'd highly recommend checking out <a href="http://www.joshholmes.com/">Josh
Holmes'</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/joshholmes/the-lost-art-of-simplicity">The Lost
Art of Simplicity</a> talk.  He presented it in the uncon, but accept it as a
keynote if he submits it to your conference.
</p>
<p>

Speaking of Microsoft (Josh works for them) they stepped up in a huge way
Wednesday night.  The topic of what to do after the Ask Zend session that night
and the idea of heading up to San Francisco came up.  Josh jumped into gear and
not only got us into the Bing party that was going on in conjunction with Web
2.0, but also scored us all copies of Windows 7 and a party bus to get us there
and back!
</p>
<p>

Microsoft catches a lot of crap from the open-source community, some of it
warranted, but they're heading in the right direction as long as they keep
hiring guys like Josh and making them the face of Microsoft.  The company will
have no choice to change if it's made up guys who are really taking the <a href="http://gapingvoid.com/2006/10/30/the-blue-monster/">blue monster</a> to
heart.
</p>
<p>

The cynic in me has to ask if this isn't just a long-view version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish">embrace,
extend, and extinguish</a> via slowly causing liver failure in the main
contributors to open source! :-D
</p>
<p>

I also finally got a <a href="http://rubyrags.com/products/10">Fork You</a>
shirt from the guys over at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.  I'm
thinking of forking the shirt design and updating it to say:
</p>

<blockquote>Fork Me</blockquote>

<p>
On the Git front, I might have made <a href="http://elizabethmariesmith.com/">Elizabeth M. Smith</a> mad enough at
the state of the current Git Windows tools to actually do something about it.
She started hacking a bit on it at the conference, and I'm sure we'll see
something by the end of the year (right, Liz?).
</p>

<p>
Next up for me (and my final conference of 2009) is the <a href="http://it-republik.de/php/phpconference09/"> International PHP
Conference</a> in Germany.  I'll be giving a talk titled Building Real-Time
Applications using XMPP.  Meg is tagging along and we're going to see some of
southern Germany after the conference.  Definitely looking forward to the time
off on another continent.
