title: Yet Another Microsoft Summit
---
<p>I'll be headed out to Redmond the end of October for Microsoft's Web Technology Summit.  From the itinerary it sounds like there might be some overlap from the previous summit I was at, but there's some specific PHP sessions at this one that sound interesting.  I know there's a camp inside MS that really wants PHP and Windows to get along better, so it'll be interesting to see what they're up to.  Thus far, nothing's come up about an <abbr title="non-disclosure agreement">NDA</abbr>, so I'll be blogging it up again... just fair warning to my non-computer geek reader.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Hit the wrong key and published too soon. :-)</p>

<p>Question for the community at large: who's attending?  It's not a public summit so I'm curious who will all was invited.</p>
