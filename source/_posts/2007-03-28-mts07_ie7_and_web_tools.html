title: MTS07 - IE7 and Web Tools
---
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/">Pete LePage</a>, Product Manager of WebTools in IE.  His job is to make sure the web developers have a good tool to use.</p>

<p>He's got three slides, then the "Beat Up Pete" session where we get to ask questions.  First one up I hope - When do IE drop it's own engine and start implementing on top of Gecko?</p>

<p>They've got 500 million IE users worldwide and they're worried about changes affecting them.  ie.Next is the tool - IE8 or whatever comes next.  They are starting to plan it now.</p>

<p>Things people want to see in the next IE:</p>
<ul><li>improved support for media formats (vorbis, etc.)</li>
<li>Cavnas object</li>
<li>Extensions that are easier to work with (think XPI)</li>
<li>Inline search/search-as-you-type</li></ul>

<p>Got the answer I expected on removing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(layout_engine)">Trident</a> from IE.  "If you replace rendering, what about javascript; then javascript, what next?"  It's too coupled with the Windows experience to start pulling it out.  I understand it from a company control standpoint, but I don't know if it's necessarily one I agree with.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: One point I didn't make which actually didn't occur to me until after I started thinking on the "why" of dropping Gecko in the back-end.  The whole hindsight's 20/20, etc.  Anyhow, the point is that the actual rendering is the one thing we can't programmatically handle.  Javascript we <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">can</a> <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">and</a> <a href="http://mootools.net/">have</a> overcome, but CSS can't be handled without ugly hacks that might or might not work in ie.Next.</p>

<p>Gecko might not be the answer, but having a third-party rendering engine that can be used by anyone without licensing/<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> concerns would be extremely useful to developers.</p>
