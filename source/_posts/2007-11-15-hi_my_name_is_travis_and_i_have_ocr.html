title: Hi, my name is Travis and I have OCR

<p>There is just something about my nature, but I can't look at "sub-optimal" code and not want to start refactoring.  It's gotten so bad lately, I think I have <abbr title="Obsessive Compulsive Refactoring">OCR</abbr> Syndrome: Obsessive Compulsive Refactoring Syndrome.  What?  You say that's not a disease?!  Well that's because you don't suffer from it! ;-)</p>

<p>Of course, it hasn't helped that my night time reading of late has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRefactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code%2Fdp%2F0201485672%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1195137997%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Refactoring</a> by Fowler.  It's been a few years since I've picked it up and read through it, but the other evening, for some reason, it seemed like a good choice.  Nearly every single refactoring listed in there brings to mind some code I've seen in the last 6 months in various places.  I wonder if it's considered rude to send a copy of that out as a Christmas present? ;-)</p>

<p>At any rate, it's reminded exactly how valuable a concept it really is.  The other day I was asked by a colleague at <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/">SugarCRM</a> what books or websites I frequently referred to when doing performance work so he could pass them on to other developers in the company.  I immediately responded with <i>Refactoring</i>.  In my opinion, it is ten times easier to make good code run fast, than to take bad code and make it run fast.   Of course, you know what they say about opinions...</p>
