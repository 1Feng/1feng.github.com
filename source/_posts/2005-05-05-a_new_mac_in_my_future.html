title: A new Mac in my future?
---
<p>I've been thinking about buying a new computer.  I already have a handful of Linux machines, and one that I can boot into Windows XP Pro whenever I need a slow, unreliable system, so I was thinking about giving a Mac a try.  It's the one operating system that I'm not comfortable in doing day-to-day stuff in.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'm clueless as to what to look for in a Mac.  I'm trying to decide between an iBook/PowerBook and a mini-Mac.  I may use it some for a little bit of programming and design, otherwise it would be used for Internet stuff and video/photo editing.  I can handle most of my photo editing in the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, but video editing in Linux is more trouble than it should be.</p>

<p>I know some of my readers are Macites (or something along those lines) and would appreciate any feedback you can offer.  Moving from a PC to Mac, what are the things that differ that I need to look at?  Are there any specs I should keep an eye on?</p>
