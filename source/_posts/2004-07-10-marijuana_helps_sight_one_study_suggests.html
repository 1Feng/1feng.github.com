title: Marijuana helps sight?  One study suggests so...
---
<p>This is an interesting <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/news/story/0,12976,1255752,00.html?=rss,">article</a> - it looks like smoking marijuana could increase the smoker's night-vision.  Look at all the money we're spending on the military for night-vision goggles that could be saved.  And then there's the <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/enforcement/">Border Patrol</a> who are always complaining about not having enough technology to fight the immigrants (scourge that they are) and all this time they've just been confiscating and destroying the natural remedy to their night vision shortcomings.</p>

<p>This article comes to me by way of <a href="http://www.bloggit.co.uk/index.php?title=only_trouble_was_she_said_i_couldn_t_sta&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">Bloggit</a>.</p>
