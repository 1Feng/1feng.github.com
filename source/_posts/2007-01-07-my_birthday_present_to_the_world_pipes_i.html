<p>Well, at least the geeky part of it...  I just finished tagging a release for <a href="http://phpinpipes.org/">Pipes</a>, a new PHP framework I've been playing with in my spare time for the last month or two.  This is the <a href="http://phpinpipes.org">first release</a> of what I hope will be many.</p>

<p>Cool features worth mentioning:</p>
<ul><li>Automatic code generation</li>
<li>Full database reflection so there's no configuring objects to work the database, they just do</li>
<li>Built-in tagging</li></ul>

<p>I'm sure there's more worth mentioning, but I've spent the last two days trying to keep from getting a cold so my mind's not fully here.  Something about the 6th of January.  Last year I had the same problem... Of course then, it was because I'd been on a bike putting in serious miles every day of the year.  This year, I'm not sure what's up.</p>

<p>Anyhow, if you're a rich open-source software benefactor that would like fund a great new project, leave me a comment. :-)</p>
