title: Photos from Deer Valley NMBS
---
<p>I took a <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/2006-NORBA-Deer-Vally/">bunch of pictures</a> Saturday and for the 30+ expert men's short track on Sunday.  They're just in a raw dump form now.  I started putting some names with the women's photos, but haven't finished.  I'll have to wait for the full results with bib numbers before I can get them all in.</p>

<p>I also have a new <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/weekly-photo/">featured photo</a>.  One of the <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/weekly-photo/Shonny-Vandlandingham-charging-up-the-last-climb.jpg.html">pictures of Shonny</a> came out pretty good, so it's this week's photo.</p>
