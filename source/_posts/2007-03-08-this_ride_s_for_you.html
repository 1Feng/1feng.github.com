title: This ride's for you...

<p>If you haven't noticed (or read these posts in a feed reader), I've added a <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog">moblog</a>.  It's just pictures taken and posted from my camera phone.  I <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog/030807_13531.jpg.html">posted</a> <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog/030807_14001.jpg.html">a</a> <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog/030807_14361.jpg.html">few</a> from this afternoon's ride.</p>

<p>Today was beautiful.  A high of 60~, those big fluffy clouds in the sky, a tolerable wind, and mountains in view.  Today was only the second time I've been on a mountain bike up here this year, and it was a spiritual experience.  Like all good <em>societies</em>, it's hard to explain what the spiritual part of mountain biking is like to the uninitiated.</p>

<p>Coming back from my explorations of the <a href="http://www.aztrail.org/passages/pass_31.html">AZ Trail</a>, I hit <abbr title="Forest Road">FR</abbr> 303 and was just cruising along.  I got into this meditative state that was just pure bliss.  Flow is what I've heard it called; the zone, effortless motion, they all describe it.  As I cranked out the trip home, I got to thinking about all of the people in my life that have made me the person I am today and gave me what was necessary to make the choices to be here, on a national park's forest road, amongst the pines, sun shining down as I hit that state of nirvanic exhaustion and it crossed my consciousness that I haven't thanked them all.</p>

<p>So thanks.  To each and every one of you who've made me who I am - and you know who you are - thanks.  This ride's for you. :-)</p>
