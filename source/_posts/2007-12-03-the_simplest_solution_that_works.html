title: The simplest solution that works
---
<p>I've never known a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas">Dave Thomas</a> I didn't like.  Both the <a href="http://speeddream.com/">wheel builder</a> and the <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/">pragmatic guru</a>.  The latter just announced <a href="http://pragprog.com/">his company's</a> new Wishlist 3.0 (or that's what I would have called it).  </p>

<blockquote><p>... we wanted to create a kind of wish list feature for our shiny new online store. It would be a system that would allow our readers tell their non-technical relatives and friends the titles that they'd love to see under the tree.</p>

<p>So I got to planning. We've got all the power we need to create something special. I sketched out the mother of all wish lists, with referral logic, automated suggestions based on other people's wish lists, privacy settings, e-mail and web fulfillment, and so on and so on. It was to be a work of art.</p>

<p>Then, for once, I stopped to think.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then they created a <a href="http://pragprog.com/forms/wishlist.pdf">PDF</a> with their titles on it so people could print it out and give it to anyone.  Any good programmer can create an application; it takes a great one to realize that sometimes it isn't necessary.</p>
