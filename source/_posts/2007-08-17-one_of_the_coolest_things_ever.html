title: One of the coolest things ever
---
<p>So in getting <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/moblog/080607_14521.jpg.html">my MacBook</a> setup over the last few weeks, I spent some time looking for a good wallpaper.  At first I thought I'd just throw up a collection of photos from <a href="http://wvs.topleftpixel.com/">Top Left Pixel</a> and let them rotate.  That worked, but then I came across <a href="http://osxplanet.com/">OS X Planet</a>.  Complete geekery, but I think its pretty cool to be able to see at a glance roughly what time it is anywhere in the world and check out the current cloud systems to see what's up.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know... I'm a geek.</p>
