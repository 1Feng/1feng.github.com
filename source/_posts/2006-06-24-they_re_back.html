title: They're back...

<p>Oh yeah...  This morning felt great.  Got up late, so I didn't want to do anything too big.  Probably a good idea because some cloud cover from last night kept it warm and had the humidity up this morning.  Not pleasant riding conditions, but I felt really on.</p>

<p>Started off with a couple micro-intervals (7:30 minutes with 15 sec on/off).  Then did a 5 minute interval at 8.5-9 <abbr title="Rate of Perceived Effort">RPE</abbr>.  I had to go off of RPE because my <abbr title="Heart Rate">HR</abbr> was about 10 <abbr title="Beats Per Minute">BPM</abbr> higher than it normally is.  The effect of taking 4 days off of the bike?  Coming back into Fountain Hills, on that 6% climb, I was actually in recovery mode.  My speed was pretty low, but I was able to spin up it at about 75% - 80% of the speed I was able to do it 3 months ago.  The last half (maybe 200 - 300 yards) I kicked it up with a good sprint.  Got up to 18 mph and held it... on a 6% grade.  And all of this with my legs still feeling a little sluggish when I started out.</p>

<p>Followed this up with some steep climbing (nothing over 12%) around the northern side of Fountain Hills with <a href="http://www.greenday.com/">Green Day's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0002OERI0%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1151172357%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">American Idiot</a> setting my pace.  The last song which ended as I pulled into garage from the ride was Letterbomb.  The chorus to this qualifies as an anthem for everyone who harbors secret desires to be an <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/04/09/dawn_til_dust_race_report#c6217">enduro fruitcake</a>:</p>

<p>Yup... As long as you're not dead there's still energy to keep going.</p>
