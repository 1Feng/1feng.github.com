title: First fill up of the TDI
---
<p>Welp, the results are in.  Here's what my car's computer spit out on the first fill-up:</p>

<blockquote><p><abbr title="Miles Per Gallon">MPG</abbr>: 32.0<br />
Total Miles: 423<br />
Average <abbr title="Miles Per Hour">MPH</abbr>: 27<br />
Total Drive Time: 15:34</p>

<p>Gallons to Fill-up: 13.448 <br />
Total Cost: $25.00</p></blockquote>

<p>That's all mixed driving including an hour looking at houses around Briarcliff (lots of short steep hills).  In driving around on the highway, I routinely see mid-40s in the current <abbr title="Miles Per Gallon">MPG</abbr> reading.  Going south on 169 near the airport - the flattest road around here that I know of - I can hit 45 MPG with the cruise set at 60.  Not bad in my opinion.</p>
