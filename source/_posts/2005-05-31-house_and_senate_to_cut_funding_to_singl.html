title: House and Senate to cut funding to single track
---
<p>It looks like the <a href="http://www.imba.com/news/action_alerts/05_05/05_20_rtp_threat.html">House and Senate might be cutting funding</a> to mountain bike trails.  At risk in Missouri is funding that could equate  to <a href="http://www.imba.com/news/action_alerts/05_05/05_20_rtp_funding.html">300+ miles</a> (scroll down to Missouri) of new singletrack.</p>

<p>Please do your part and <a href="http://www.imba.com/news/action_alerts/05_05/05_20_rtp_letter.html">sign this letter</a> to your representative and let them know that you support funding for mountain biking.</p>
