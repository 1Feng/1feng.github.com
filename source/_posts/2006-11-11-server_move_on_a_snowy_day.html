title: Server move on a snowy day
---
<p>I finally got my hosting for this server moved over to <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/10/23/switching_to_dreamhost">Dreamhost</a>.  If you tried to come to my site earlier in the day, you probably noticed a message saying it was down for maintenance, that's why...</p>

<p>Just finished getting the garage straightened up.  Now I can pull my car in to the garage again.  Only having a one car garage in Fountain Hills my bikes tended to get priority.  With a two car garage, there's room for all my babies plus my car.  I couldn't have timed it better - tonight there's a chance to snow:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mostly cloudy. Slight chance of rain showers in the evening...then chance of rain and snow showers after midnight. Snow level around 7000 feet after midnight. Southwest winds 10 to 20 mph and gusty in the evening becoming light. Lows 31 to 37. Chance of precipitation 50 percent.</p></blockquote>
