title: Car dealers gone wild...
---
<p>I've been thinking about getting a <a href="http://www.hybridcars.com/">hybrid car</a>.  I like the idea of the increased fuel economy and doing my part to help the environment out.  I would like to check out a Prius, but upon investigation yesterday I found out that there is as much as a two year waiting list and the local Toyota dealer has even stopped taking orders for them!  The only other one that I would be interested in is the Escape Hybrid from Ford.</p>

<p>Ok, now that you've got your jaw off of the floor... yes, I did say I was interested in an SUV.  It's an eco-friendly SUV, and I'm not your <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/12/23/another_reason_to_hate_some_suv_drivers">normal SUV driver</a>.  I put in a quick phone call to the local Ford dealership, and they have one in stock.  Last night I went to check it out, it's fully loaded.  Surprise, surprise, it's got <em>all</em> of the options so it costs the most.  But to top it off, it even has some extras... or so I thought.</p>

<p>After taking it for a spin, I stopped back by to check out the price before I head home.  The sticker MSRP is $32.8k.  Steep enough, but then there's a $4,000 "ADM" hand-written in marker added under "Dealer Installed Options".  It was late and I had already taken up enough of my salesman's time, so I just figured I would give him a buzz today.  This afternoon I was informed that the additional $4k was just added on over the MSRP because they're in such high demand!  You've got that right - they're tacking on more than 10% just because they feel they can!  Guess we now know that ADM stands for "Above Dealer Msrp"!</p>

<p>I know it's a supply and demand issue, but living here in KC we've been producing those Escape Hybrids for nearly a year and they're trying to say that in that time they're still on a "who knows when we'll get the next one" basis?  Can we say "price fixing"?  You know, it's great that these monopolies - err, benevolent giants are trying to help the environment out by <strong>finally</strong> producing vehicles that don't consume any more gas than they need to - I mean, the fact that oil reserves are on the short track to extinction has just come out of nowhere!  But seriously... 10% over retail.  Do I have to provide my own condom, or will you provide one while you rape me!</p>

<p>Geez... So, my hybrid adventures have ended for the time being.  I'm not going to pay full MSRP much less $4k over so I can save a hundred bucks or so a year in gas.  And with this <a href="http://www.hybridcars.com/calculator/index.php">spiffy calculator on HybridCars.com</a> I found out that my Hyundai actually emits less pollutants into the air than the Escape Hybrid would.  So I guess I'll do the environmentally sensible thing and stick with my small-engine, fully gas car.</p>
