title: Da Gu-ve-na-tah for President!
---
<p>Phil Libin at <a href="http://www.vastlyimportant.com/">Vastly Important</a> has a <a href="http://www.vastlyimportant.com/vastly/2004/07/ask_a_softball_.html">funny article</a> about the endless supply of answers that Gov. Schwarzenegger has at his disposal from his acting career.  He referenced the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/">Governor's IMDb entry</a>.  There's some interesting things there, including a message <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/board/nest/8714425">Arnold to become PRESIDENT!!!</a>.  I think this could be the first campaign that could actually be billed as an action movie.  Just what politics needed, something that people would actually be interested in!</p>
