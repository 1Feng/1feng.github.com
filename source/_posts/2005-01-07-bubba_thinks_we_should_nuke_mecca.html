title: Bubba thinks we should nuke Mecca
---
<p>Well, you can't say that <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=42272">WorldNetDaily</a> doesn't have a diverse readership.  Oh wait?  You can?  They do have a bunch of back-water religious fanactics who just got Internet on their dirtroad last year?  Oops...</p>

<p>All joking aside - more than 85% of their readers think that the US should threaten a nuclear strike on Mecca if there is another terrorist attack!  Yeah, that would be great.  And we should threaten the Vacatin the next time a Christian nut <a href="http://www.gynpages.com/birmingham/">blows up an abortion clinic</a>?  Oh, and we should nuke Jerusalem the next time a Zionist blows up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing">King David Hotel</a>.  That'll get a lot done...</p>
