title: It takes all types
---
<p>I'm flying this afternoon via PHX.  I'm waiting on my next plane and sitting across from what looks like the three charter members of some <abbr title="United Methodist Church">UMC</abbr> Women's Group, across from them is a primadonna in with her $400 Chanel sunglasses/hairband, and a few seats down from her is two of cowboys, one of whom is wearing a pro rodeo belt buckle and a leather jacket that has a couple of dozen sponsor's logos embroidered on the front and arms.</p>

<p>It really does take all types to make the world go round, eh?</p>
