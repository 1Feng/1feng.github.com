title: Matchstick Men
---
<p>I'm not a big movie person.  Being the techno-mystic that I am, I really enjoyed the Matrix Trilogy.  I've always liked the types of movies that draw on our collectively rich spiritual history.  The original Star Wars trilogy did the same thing.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B00012QLB4/qid%3D1086926423/sr%3D1-1">Matchstick Men</a> doesn't fit that mold.  It's a "comedic thriller", as the back cover says.  It should also say:</p>

<p>"One damn fine movie..." - The Man, The Myth, The Legend... Travis Swicegood</p>

<p>Ok, so maybe I'll get my name on the back of the 2nd release.  This ranks up there with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B00005V9HH/qid%3D1086926677/sr%3D1-1">Usual Suspects</a> as one of the best movies I've seen.  This movie is a bit slower than I would have liked, so I can't say it's the best.  But if you're a fan of Nicolas Cage and like the type of movies that Spacey generally plays in, I think you'll find this one quite worth 2 hours of your time.</p>

<p>On a side note, I really thought I had seen somewhere that Cage was among Hollywood's left-handed population.  I know we share the same birthday.  I thought we had the same handedness as well, but throughout this movie he is right-handed: he bowls right-handed, he writes right-handed.  Hmm...</p>
