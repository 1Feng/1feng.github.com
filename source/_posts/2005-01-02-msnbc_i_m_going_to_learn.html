<p>Here's an interesting piece by way of <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/">Drudge</a> about Kerry in the post-election.</p>

<p>Both sides are always misquoted - even I've been misquoted in papers - but if this is true, this is the most poignant part:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Kerry] wanted to show a letter from a schoolgirl that had been left on his stoop. The letter read, in part, "John Kerry, you're the greatest!" Kerry looked into the reporter's eye. "The pundits have never liked me," he said. "Is it the way I look? The way I sound?" He seemed vulnerable for a moment, then caught himself, smiled and walked home to his empty house.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Is it the way I look?  The way I sound?" - those are the words of a man <em>desperately</em> trying to figure out what went wrong...</p>
