title: An online chess project?
---
<p>As some would have you believe, it would be an exercise in intellectual masturbation to redo this rather than contribute to/build upon it, but <a href="http://somechess.org/web/">something like this</a> would be fun to implement.  I'm thinking doing a JS/AJAX way for modern browsers so it works like a regular desktop chess game.</p>

<p>I've got too many ideas for fun little projects to implement and just not enough time to implement them all.</p>
