title: Mailman - oh the pain...
---
<p>Ok... I love a good mailing list as much as the next nerd, but come on people.  Mailman is a pain in the butt to setup.  It took me nearly an hour to <a href="http://wiki.travisswicegood.com/index.php/Forward_qmail_message_to_mailman">remember how to set it up with qmail</a>...  I had everything I needed right in front of me, if only I had been turned around.  Then, it took me just as long to find out fix_url was actually the script I needed to move the domain name one of my lists was listed on.  I swear, the dozen other times I listed /home/mailman/bin it wasn't there.  My server has a gnome on it that's moving files around on me...</p>

<p>Long story short... I finally have mailman setup.  After having it running on my server for nearly half a year, I can actually say "it's ready".  If you're of the programmer type, you might find some of the lists interesting.  They're all very low traffic right now (some of them being just me on the list), but they'll get bigger now that the rest of the world knows about them.  So where are they?  <a href="http://list.domain51.net/mailman/listinfo">Right here</a>, of course.</p>

<p>Quick break down:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://list.domain51.net/mailman/listinfo/d51toolkit-dev">d51toolkit-dev</a> will be about <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/d51Toolkit/">d51Toolkit</a> development</li>
<li><a href="http://list.domain51.net/mailman/listinfo/phpcr-dev">phpcr-dev</a> is about <a href="http://www.phpcr.org/">phpCR</a> development</li>
<li>and finally <a href="http://list.domain51.net/mailman/listinfo/scribbleforge-dev">scribbleforge-dev</a> is for <a href="http://www.scribbleforge.com/">Scribble Forge</a> development</li></ul>
