<p>Sorry I haven't posted more here recently; been busier than normal.  Tuesday ended a week and a half off of the bike (except for a few 30 minute spins).  Felt good, but was slow.  I was planning on hill intervals on the road bike this morning, but woke up to lightning and rain?!  This afternoon maybe?  A cold front is moving through, so it's only going to be in the upper 90s :)</p>
