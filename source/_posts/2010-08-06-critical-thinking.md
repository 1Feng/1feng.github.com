subtitle: Musing on the Twitter Generation

By now, I hope we've all read [Is Google Making Us Stupid][] from 
[The Atlantic][].  Here's the quick version, which ironically makes the
author's point:

People are changing the way they interact with the world, which is changing the
way their brains model the world, which is changing their brains.  We're not
exercising the critical, reflective part of our brains; instead, we're using
almost exclusively the parts that focus on quick, immediate activities.  We're
skimming everything rather than thinking more critically, more reflectively.

The reaction to the [Shirley Sherrod][] case is an excellent example of this.
Rather than step back, the [NAACP][] and [White House][] jumped on it and
stepped in the heaping pile of burning feces that was laid at their doorstep.

So what's this got to do with *thinking* and Twitter and such?  Well, it's the
reason I've started blogging again.  I don't want to lose my ability, what little
it sometimes appears to be, of critical thinking and reasoning so I'm starting
to blog more.

I noticed my thought process was becoming much more reactionary and shallow.  I
was allowing the insignificant to bubble up and take over.  Rather than ponder
something and try to write out, I was firing off a quick tweet and calling it a
day.  Couldn't fit it in a tweet?  Oh well, it must not be *that* important.

So that's why I'm coming back to blogging.  The first four years I ran this
blog, I had over 100 posts each year---closing in on 200 in 2006.  Starting in
2008, however, I let it slide. 66, 22, and then only 13 posts so far this year.
I'm working on reversing that trend.
