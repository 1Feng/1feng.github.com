title: I won... and some other updates
---
<p>Thanks for everyone who voted for me in the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/company/newsroom/press/2007_05_18_0">Komodo contests</a>.  I managed to pull off the win in the extension category and third place in the toolbox category for a grand total of $600 worth of Amazon gift cards and a license for <a href="http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_ide/">Komodo IDE</a> which costs $295.  Not bad for a couple of afternoons worth of playing around with it.</p>

<p>In other news, I'm now at nearly a week with no meat.  I'm doing the veggie thing for awhile.  I've done it before for a little over a month, so it's nothing new.  The big difference is that this time I actually like green leafy vegetables, so it'll probably be a bit easier to come up with things to eat.  I made some burritos last week with soy meat crumbles and had I made them and feed them to you, I seriously doubt you could have told the difference.  That just re-enforced my thought that the majority of meat in my diet is just there for texture - the flavors are coming from other sources.</p>

<p>Riding has been lax lately.  I planned on getting some riding in this weekend, but other events and the weather conspired against me.  Both days were a little on the chilly side with a light misty rain a good part of the day.  Next weekend I'm planning on hitting the mountain Saturday.  Some of the Phoenix crowd is coming up to do a few days of camping and riding.  I've only been over to the mountain a few times this year, so I'm looking forward to some elevation therapy.  I'm thinking that coming down the Catwalk, through the Hobbit Forest, and down Little Bear are musts.  I might have to repent of my lack of riding by heading up to the Eldon Lookout via the road too.  Its sounding like fun... :-)  The last time I spent a few day playing around on the mountain I ended up with something like 5k of climbing (and descending) with only 20 miles of riding.  </p>
