title: I must be really sick...
---
<p>... or I've subconsciously slipped into spring training mode.  Today was the first time that I can remember where I was barely able to stomach a half a <a href="http://www.redbaron.com/publish/products_classic.htm">pizza</a>.  I normally can eat 3/4ths no problem, and most days I can eat a whole one.  Today at lunch the second piece was agony to finish - all the grease, seemed so heavy, just felt bad going down.</p>

<p>I guess this is my body's way of telling me to shape up.  I've actually been in bed at a decent hour every night and the latest I've woken up is 7:30 and today I woke up at a quarter to 7 beating my alarm up.  I guess now that my body's back in a circadian rhythm, it wants good food.</p>

<p>Here comes Gallup tomorrow!</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's Note</legend>For my non-cyclist readers, spring training mode for me generally involves eating much better and finally getting out of the bad habits I got into over the winter: eating poorly, drinking more than I should, not riding as much as I should, etc.  It's normally accompanied by a drop in body fat into the sub-10 range along with a drop in weight.</fieldset>
