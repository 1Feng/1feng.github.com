Finally got around to converting some old code from SVN to Git and getting it
up on [GitHub][].  It's like looking back through a time-warp actually, as most
of the code hasn't been touched since the summer of 2007.

Nearly all of the code is usable, but it's all abandoned at this point.  If
there's something there that strikes your fancy and you'd be interested in
forking it into your own project, feel free.

There are still a few more to go, but you can start checking them out now at
the [Domain51 Github account][@domain51].  Just search for `Domain51_` to
filter the listing as they're all named in the old PEAR-style package naming
scheme.
