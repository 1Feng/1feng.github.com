title: The two wheeled species, explained

<p>Via <a href="http://cyclinglyfestyle.blogspot.com/2007/10/frank-speaks-caveman.html">Squirrel</a>, <a href="http://biketopia.blogspot.com/2007/10/cross-referencing-cyclists-or.html">Cross Referencing Cyclists, or the Differences in the Disciplines</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite is the 24 hour guy:</p>

<blockquote><p>I literally do not know where this species has come from or why they even still exist. I affectionately look upon the 24 hour team or solo mountain biker for that matter as the Nymphomaniac of the cycling world. Their motto? "If a little is good, 24 hours of it must be fucking awesome!"</p></blockquote>
