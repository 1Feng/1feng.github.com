title: Wheels are ready tomorrow!
---
<p>So when I talked to <a href="http://www.speeddream.com/">Dave</a> earlier in the week about <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/03/07/new_wheels_are_on_the_way">my new wheels</a> he said to give him a call Friday or so to make sure everything got in and that he'd be able to build up the wheels without any delay.  I told him I wasn't in a big hurry, but that I was going to be racing on them in a few weeks at <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/event_detail.php?event_id=139">Nova</a> to which he said "ok, I'll mark them as ASAP and should have them by for you by next Tuesday."  So I call him up today to check in on them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, I've got everything together for them and I'm going to build them tonight.  I'll drop them off at the shop tomorrow morning for you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah!  Sweet!  These are hand built, super light, super tough wheels (from everything I've read about them) and they're a few hundred bucks cheaper than CrossMax's from Mavic.  And the turn around is literally 3 days to get them!  Dave's my hero!</p>

<p>The only problem is that there's a 90% chance of rain tomorrow, so I probably won't get to ride them.  No bother though, that'll give me a chance to get them setup and I want to run new shifter cables on my Sugar anyway.  As soon as I get a chance to take 'em for a spin, I'll post up my initial thoughts.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you see me in the next day or so and it looks like I'm walking funny, I am.  The reason: it's called a gym and they would be better called houses of self-inflicted torture and torturing devices.</p>
