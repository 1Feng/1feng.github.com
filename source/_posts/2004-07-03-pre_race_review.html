title: Pre-race review

<p>We're thirty minutes from the start of live coverage here in the US.  In an interview yesterday, Lance said "it's going to go down before the Alps."  He's thinking the first real mountain stages in the Pyrenees is where the race is going to be won or lost.  Last year, that was definitely the case.</p>

<p>The entire OLN team is saying Lance is the guy this year.  The bookies have adjusted their odds though.  He was at 14 to 1, now it's 7 to 1.  The final three starters are the favored winners. - Hamilton, Ullrich, Armstrong.  With Millar out of the race <a href="http://www.furl.net/item.jsp?id=505548">while he's under investigation</a> the top time trialist is out of the race.  One of the last three could win...</p>
