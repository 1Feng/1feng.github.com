title: When it rains it pours
---
<p>Ok - so I move to Phoenix two weeks after a drought starts.  Rain is a vague memory by this time.  But today...  Today, I get new wheels for my bike and what does it do?  Nothing... well, except for rain <strong>all</strong> day!  If I'm lucky I'll get in some riding tomorrow on the road, but my new wheels will get stuck in the stable for a bit while the ground dries up.  This should actually be great for <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/event_detail.php?event_id=139">Nova</a> in a few weeks, but still.  Couldn't it have waited until tomorrow or Monday?</p>

<p>Now that I have the wheels, I have the actual weight on them: 737g for the front and 889g for the rear for a grand total of 1626 grams.  For those keeping track, that's 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of a pound lighter than Bontrager's Race Disc and even more than their Race Lite Disc (don't ask me, Race <em>Lite</em> wheels are heavier).  Throw in that I'm cutting weight for the rim tape and strip in the Bontragers and I start getting really close to dropping a pound in rotational weight.  I really can't wait to get on some dirt and try these babies out.</p>
