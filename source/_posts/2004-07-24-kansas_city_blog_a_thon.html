<p>Patrick and company over at <a href="http://www.kcbloggers.com/">KCBloggers.com</a> are participating in a <a href="http://www.kcbloggers.com/index.php?p=165">blog-a-thon</a> to raise money for <a href="http://www.heartofamericahs.org/">The Heart of America Humane Society</a>.  So far, they've got the $175 they started with.  I'll be putting my two cents in today to help the cause and would strongly encourage you to!</p>
