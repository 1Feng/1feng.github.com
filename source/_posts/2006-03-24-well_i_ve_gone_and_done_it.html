title: Well, I've gone and done it
---
<p>Pigs flew, the cows came home, and I understand the ice made it all the way to El Paso.  I <strong>won</strong> my age group.  I put in a decent effort considering, but wasn't 100% happy with it.  That said, they gave out the awards about 35 minutes after I got back in, and 2nd and 3rd place in my category (Men 19 - 29) weren't even back yet!  I'd been back for 5 minutes or so when I saw one of the other guys I was racing against at about the 40% mark on the course where you come back through the parking lot to go out for the long loop.</p>

<p>The reason I wasn't happy is the way I raced the first lap.  I knew one of my biggest enemies would be getting caught up in the initial climb and blasting through it.  I had been turning the Sport/Tech loop in just under 30 minutes, I came through at 25!  I should have slowed down, but I was feeling so good.  I ended up turning my first lap in something like 1:03!  If I could have kept that pace, that'd have been awesome (not too mention to fastest non-pro time).  My times went up from there though.</p>

<p>Of course, there's always the excuses.  This was the hottest ride I've done since last fall when I first moved here.  We topped out at 80 - actually, they shortened the race one lap because of the heat (something I am extremely grateful for).  I had my 1 liter per lap figured out from <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/03/18/nova_marathon_course_beta_for_mere_morta_1">last week's pre-ride</a> and didn't take into account the 15 or so degree difference between the conditions.  Almost needless to say, I ran out of water on two of the laps.  </p>

<p>The other issue I had was shifting.  On the last two laps, I basically had three gears, my 24-34-44 and my 34 tooth on the cassette.  I blew out my (practically) brand new shifter cable somewhere on the course and couldn't get it to shift at all.  If I really torqued down on the shifter I could sometimes get it to shift a gear or two, but it was random.  I ended up burning a blister into my hand over the shifter trying to get it to shift.  I also rubbed the Sram off of the grip.</p>

<p>Anyhow, showing up and finishing today would have netted me a podium - only three racers showed up for the amateur 19 - 29.  All the fast 20 somethings were in the Open/Pro category, but just the same, I did show up and I did manage a "good enough" ride.  Wow, my first <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/">Norba National</a> race and my first mountain bike win.  What a combination.  I think I'll have a grin on my face for at least a week. :D</p>
