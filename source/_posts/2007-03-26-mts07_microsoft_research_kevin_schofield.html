<p>"General manager of research of everything else...  Things that don't require researchers."</p>

<p>They're working on some cool new computing models.  Cameras and computers that can recognize a "virtual/real" environment that allows you to interact with real environment that is representing a partially virtual environment.  i.e., playing checkers with a half </p>

<p>They found out that the light in the refrigerator does go out using a 'SenseCam' in the frig.  Practical uses include memory aids for people that have problems with memory.  On one patient, there was a 2.5x memory recall over 3 months for someone who couldn't remember longer than one week.</p>

<p>Heat density on Pentium processor is currently hotter than a nuclear reaction and approaching that of a rocket nozzle.  AMD/Intel think that a 5.0Ghz processor is as fast as it'll be able to get.  That's the reason behind multi-core processors.</p>

<p>35% of project time spent on debugging.  </p>

<p>"Composability allows us to deal with complexity in a way that  yields orders of magnitude more concurrency."</p>

<p>The focus in the abbreviated Q&amp;A was concurrency and when it'll be available.  Kevin is optimistic, but some in the audience seemed to believe that it wasn't going to happen due to the time/money/energy that had already been put into it.</p>
