title: Fuck off, humanity!

<p><em><strong>Update</strong>:As pointed out by a commenter, the original post seems to have been a hoax.  On the one hand, I'm glad this didn't actually take place, on the other, I'm saddened because it didn't seem that out of the realm of possibility.</em></p>

<p><em>Author's note: This is for me, and me alone.  Don't like it?  Don't agree?  Replace "humanity" in the title with your name.</em></p>

<p><strong>There, I said it.  I just got through reading <a href="http://aebrain.blogspot.com/2009/06/im-getting-really-fed-up-of-things-like.html">this post</a> (warning, you'll hate humanity after reading it).  Seriously people, what the fuck is your problem?</strong></p>

<p>Ok.  I'll use my inside voice now.  If you've read this blog for a long time, you know that I am firmly in the gay rights camp (it's equal protection under the law, stupid).  I've been taunted in some posts for it, called names, had family members "pray for me", etc., etc.  But the one that gets me: I've been asked "you're not gay, why do you care?"</p>

<blockquote><p>She rode her bike to go to the store. She never came home. They found her bike in a dumpster. Late that evening they found her. She had been assaulted with a sledge hammer, they think, judging from the bruises all over her body. Her knee caps had been broken. She had been gang raped. They buried her alive.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why do I care?  Cause there's a family right now that's reeling from tragedy upon tragedy.  Their father just died, their mother was maimed, and now their daughter was tortured, gang raped, then buried alive.  Think about that for a minute.  She had both of her knee caps broken with a sledge hammer, then buried alive.</p>

<p>Why do I care?  More importantly, why the <strong>fuck</strong> don't you?</p>

<p>Recently a friend of mine came out to their parents.  Their mom broke down in to tears.  Not because of any disappointment or anything like that, but because she was worried.  She was worried that the world was a mean place, and that people would be mean to them and their partner.  When I heard that for the first time, I chuckled.  I live in a little bubble in Lawrence.  That doesn't happen here.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://aebrain.blogspot.com/2009/06/im-getting-really-fed-up-of-things-like.html">this</a> is why their mom thought that.  This is what went through her mind.  What century is it again?  Are we not above this?  Have certain parts of our species not evolved past grunts and pointing?</p>

<p>Right now all I want to do is think of insanely violent and cruel things to do to the people who did this.  It doesn't serve a purpose, but it makes me feel better.  Makes me feel like I have some sort of control over this blue marble.</p>

<blockquote><p>She worked her way out of the almost grave and crawled for three hours to get help. She was put in the ICU and given little chance to survive. Last night she died.</p></blockquote>

<p>She dug herself out of the grave and crawled for 3 hours.  She got help.  Then she died.</p>

<p>Has an amazing what's it all for feeling to it.</p>
