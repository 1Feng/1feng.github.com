Welp, it seems I was the first in blogland to bring you the story, and it looks like it's going to happen.</p>

Mayor Kay Barnes today unveiled plans for a $225 million to $250 million downtown arena, saying nearly half the financing will come from Anschutz Entertainment Group, Sprint Corp., and the National Association of Basketball Coaches.</fieldset>

In the <a href="http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=kr-kcsports&amp;msg=31659.1&amp;ctx=4096">forum topic</a> about the announcement, the only complaint I saw that it was too small.  It's scheduled to have between 15,000 and 20,000 seats.  <a href="http://forums.prospero.com/dir-app/bbcard/profile.asp?webtag=kr-kcsports&amp;uid=421838537">kiimo</a>, the poster, wants to see a 35,000 seat arena.</p>

The <a href="http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=kr-kcsports&amp;msg=31660.1&amp;ctx=1">poll</a> the star is running asks readers what they want to see in the arena.  56% are hoping for an NBA team.</p>

This is big news for KC. The entire first half of the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/">Kansas City Star website</a> right now is dedicated to this story.  It'll be interesting to see if it has the favor of KC residents when it is put to the ballot on August 3rd.</p>
