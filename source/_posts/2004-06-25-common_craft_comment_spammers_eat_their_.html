title: Common Craft - Comment Spammers Eat Their Young
---
<p>I should have posted this a while back, but a few emails swapped back and forth with a local blogger about spamming reminded me of this post.  Lee had actually just been hit with if I recall correctly something like 88 spam posts.  He was rather disgusted at the collective "them", or comment spammers.  It's definitely worth a read.  The comments show exactly how organic blogs can become.</p>
