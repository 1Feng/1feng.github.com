title: Kerry a supporter of Live Strong?
---
<p>During <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/pressroom/speeches/spc_2004_0729.html">his acceptance speech</a> tonight, Democratic Presidential Candidate John Kerry was seen sporting one of Lance Armstrong's <a href="http://store.laf.org/catalog/index.php?cPath=19&amp;track_id=WEARYELLOW">Live Strong</a> bracelets.  It definitely goes with his theme of encouraging <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/issues/health_care/stemcell.html">medical research</a>.</p>
