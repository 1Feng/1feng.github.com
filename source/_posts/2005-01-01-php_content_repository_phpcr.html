title: PHP Content Repository - phpCR
---
<p>For my readers who are programmers or interested in programming type things, I thought I'd share that I've just released <a href="http://www.phpcr.org">PHP Content Repository - phpCR</a>.  It's a standard API for content repositories using PHP 5 - sounds like a world of fun huh?  If you're a programmer, it probably does.</p>
