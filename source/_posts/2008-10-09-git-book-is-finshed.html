title: Git Book is Finshed!
---
<p>It's been kind of quiet around here.  It's not that I haven't had much to say, it's that I haven't had the time to say it!  For those of you who <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">follow</a> <a href="http://plurk.com/tswicegood/">my</a> <a href="http://pownce.com/tswicegood">various</a> <a href="http://identi.ca/tswicegood">microblogs</a> probably even noticed a dip in updates over the last few weeks.  Every last ounce of energy has been put into the final push for the book and I had to cut back on the distractions to make it through.</p>

<p>Now that it's over, I get to pay attention to some majorly neglected areas.  First and foremost is my bike.  We're in the middle of a great fall here and I haven't gotten much riding in at all.  Note to self: write books in the winter, not the summer.</p>

<p>Next up is <a href="http://phpt.info/">PHPT</a>.  I've got a few people interested in helping out with it.  I'm still working toward 100% drop-in replacement for PHP's run-tests.php.  There's still a bit to go, but it's getting close.  I've got a little over a month to get it really rocking, though.  My <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/ts2/0">Testing the PHP Way: PHPT</a> tutorial was accepted to <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/index">php|works</a>, so the test suite had better be up to par before then. :-)</p>

<p>I'm also giving my <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule/talk/d1s4/2">The Future is Not Yet Widely Distributed</a> talk in the <a href="http://phpworks.mtacon.com/c/schedule">agnostic track</a>&mdash;tracks that aren't PHP or Python specific.  The talk is an hour long introduction to Git.  Now that I've <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git">written the book on Git</a>, I'd better be able to talk about it for at least an hour. :-D</p>

<p>I am planning on having both talks available as screencasts/video talks too for anyone who can't make it to the conference.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that's the quick update.  Now that I'm not spending all of my free time writing, I can get back to writing some more here for fun.  Look for some posts on programming soon.  I'm going to be learning more about <a href="http://developer.ning.com/">OpenSocial</a> now that we're <a href="http://developer.ning.com/forum/topic/show?id=1185512%3ATopic%3A67606">supporting it in a big way @ Ning</a>.</p>
