title: Democratic Billboard in downtown Kansas City causes stire
---
<p>
The Democratics in Missouri have caused a stir.  The billboard which has just made the news has been up on my way home from work for the past few days.  The Rebpulicans are upset saying it's race baiting.  The Democrats defend their billboard saying it is just the first of many different portraits.  Interesting that those choice for their first billboard though... </p>

<em>Note to Democratic party</em>: You should have had a multi-racial group of kids on the first billboard.  There would have been very little recourse from the Republicans, it would have been safer, and you could still roll out the current billbaord.</p>
