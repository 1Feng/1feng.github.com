title: Get your grind on
---
<p>I have a serious post coming up, but I wanted to get this out of the way so it doesn't distract you...</p>

<p><a href="http://tonyskansascity.com/2005/03/ride-it.html">Tony's</a> had this <a href="http://www.pitch.com/issues/2005-03-31/news/backwash.html">Pitch article</a> (second on the page) and I thought it was a joke, but apparently the good folks in <a href="http://grindline.com/cgi-bin/view.pl?view=prairie%20village/2.jpg">Pairie Village</a> thought it appropriate to build a <a href="http://grindline.com/cgi-bin/view.pl?view=prairie%20village/2.jpg">penis-shaped skatepark</a> for their kids to play in.  Makes you wonder what slang will come up for clearing tricks in certain "parts" of the park.</p>
