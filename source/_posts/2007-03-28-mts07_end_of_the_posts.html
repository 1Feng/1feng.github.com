<p>To everyone who's tired of seeing all of these posts, they're done.  I'll be heading to the airport shortly to catch a flight this evening.  Once I have a chance to digest all of the thoughts I've got, I'll probably post up a week-in-review post.  We'll see...</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you have questions about these, or you're one of the attendees and want some contact info, leave me a comment here and I'll get back in touch with you.</p>
