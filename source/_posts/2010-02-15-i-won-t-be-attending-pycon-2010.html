title: I won't be attending PyCon 2010
---
<p>This past few weeks has been crazy hectic. Business is going crazy, I'm in the final stages of launching multiple websites, and I've had a cold for the better part of two weeks.  Unfortunately, these things have been conspiring against me and this past week I had to notify PyCon that I won't be able to attend and speak this year.</p>

<p>Please accept my apologies if you were planning on attending.  I have a ton of great information together in various forms and as things get back under control I've got a slew of blog posts about testing and web dev that I'll post up.  I plan on tagging the posts with the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/pycon:">pycon</a> tag if you're interested in keeping up with them.</p>
