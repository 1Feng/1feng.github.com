<p>Yesterday morning the flurries started.  Dustings appeared wherever there was something to stop the dry snow from blowing around, but as the temperatures rose the snow disappeared.  The snow started up last night and this is what I woke up to this morning.</p>

<p>That's looking out the picture window I have in my living room here in Flag.  Sweet view, huh?</p>
