title: "The Miracle of IHOP: Prologue"

<p>Ok, since I <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/05/28/the_miracle_of_ihop#c7292">insulted</a> the <a href="http://leftof.net/2006/05/28/happy-birthday-baby-2/">birthday girl</a>, here's the lead up to my IHOP epic.</p>

<p>Saturday night was my friend <a href="http://www.leftof.net/">Megan</a>'s birthday party - the quarter century mark.  I went having no intention sticking around very late, but at 2 AM, 2/3 of a bottle of cheap Pinot and innumerable glasses of sangria later, I decided to crash on her floor since spinning worlds and driving don't mix.  I got the floor, because the couch was taken by Megan's best friend Sarah and she didn't want to share it - funny how an engagement ring will do that to <em>some</em> girls. ;)</p>

<p>A few hours later I woke up, refreshed by what essentially was a nap and headed out to IHOP with everybody for some much needed food.  It wasn't quite 6 AM when we got the pancakes (inside joke).  Surprisingly, though my head was spinning Saturday night when I went to sleep, I woke up without a hang over.  God bless a fast metabolism.</p>

<p>For the conclusion of the story, <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/05/28/the_miracle_of_ihop">read this post</a>.</p>

<p>So everybody, wish Megan a happy birthday (it'll help keep me out off of "the list").</p>
