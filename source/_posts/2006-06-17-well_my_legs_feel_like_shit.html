title: Well my legs feel like shit
---
<p>Geez...  I took yesterday, well sort of.  I was going to go for a ride, but wasn't really into the idea.  15 minutes in my rear wheel had that springy feeling of a slow leak.  Yup, lost about 70 psi.  I know when to read the signs.  Popped a cartridge worth of air into it and rode home.  So it was essentially a day off.</p>

<p>This morning, I overslept by about an hour.  Should have been sign enough for me that today needed to be an off day, but I fixed breakfast and headed out.  I was feeling decent and was planning on getting 3 - 4 hours in on the mountain bike.  45 minutes into it I would have hopped in a car and driven home had that been an option.  By the time I got off of the trail and I had spent an hour and a half on the bike, and my legs feel like they should fall off.</p>

<p>At least it's happening now, and not in a few weeks.</p>
