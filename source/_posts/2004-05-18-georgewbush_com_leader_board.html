Just got an email from the President!  Well, ok, from his campaign.  Today's email is kind of interesting as it promotes a new grassroots movement.  People like to see their name in print, even if it is a website (a la TravisSwicegood.com :) ) and the President's camp is playing on that.  They have a <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/GetActive/leaderboard.aspx">Leader Board</a> to show who their top volunteers are.  What a way to play on people's pride.</p>
