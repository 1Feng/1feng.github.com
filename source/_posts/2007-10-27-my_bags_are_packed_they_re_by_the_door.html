title: My bags are packed - they're by the door...

<p>Well, almost packed.  I still have to pack up the MacBook in the morning before I take off, but I'm basically packed.  I'm flying to Redmond, WA tomorrow (well, Seattle-Tacoma Airport, then driving to Redmond) for another Microsoft conference.  This one is a bit shorter (read: fewer posts and MS stuff), but will focus specifically on Windows and PHP and how they can all get along now.  I'll post more when I have time.  I'm sure <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">Twitter</a> will see its fair share of updates from me tomorrow while I'm away from the keyword.</p>
