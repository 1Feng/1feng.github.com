title: Busy week and some new bike porn
---
<p>I can't believe it's Friday.  I had planned to have more of my stuff packed by now, but by the time I get to the evening I'm looking to just veg out.  This means I get to spend the majority of my weekend packing so I can make up for lost time.  I've just about got all my non-essential bike shop type stuff packed.  Except for books, that's the biggest part of my stuff I have to round up and get packed and ready.  </p>

<p>You know... I kind of enjoy the post-move part of the move.  The new place, new people, new things to do; all that's great.  The packing part though... I could do without it.</p>

<p>On the bike front, I've got a new ride.  A few weeks back my road bike's rear shifter checked out.  I was planning on buying a new bike the first part of next year, so I thought it was kind of dumb to sink $250 or so into a bike I'm getting ready to hang up.  A couple shops later I found a great deal on pretty much what I wanted.  Had the Ultegra groupo and was carbon... Meet my new <a href="http://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/030.000.000/030.000.000.asp?model=11211">TCR Limited</a>:</p>

<p>Ok, so that isn't exactly my bike, but it's what it looks like.  With a different saddle, pedals, and my <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner301/">Forerunner</a> on the handlebars.  One of these days I'll actually get around to taking some pictures of it and la arana and posting them.</p>
