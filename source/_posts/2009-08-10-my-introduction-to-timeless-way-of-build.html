title: My introduction to Timeless Way of Building
---
<p>To bring my blog readers up to speed.  I posted this status update earlier in the evening:</p>

<blockquote><p>Random question: How have I made it this far and not read The Timeless Way of Building yet?</p></blockquote>

<p>I got this response from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/billkarwin">Bill Karwin</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I just heard about Christopher Alexander within the last year too. Dunno why I had not heard about him previously, given how much he influenced the OO paradigm. How did you come across him, and what has resonated with you most?</p></blockquote>

<p>I started to respond, but then Facebook cut me off.  They seem to limit the length of comments (once again, for convenience we're giving up control...  I seriously think 1,000 characters is barely enough to get started in), but since I control the spigot here and can be as long-winded as I like, I'll post my comment here.  Without further adieu...</p>

<p>I've heard of him a lot because of his Pattern Language book, but I'd never heard of this one. Reading the <a href="http://slash7.com/articles/2009/8/10/screw-interface-patterns">Screw Interface Patterns</a> article on slash7 today got me thinking about it again and I determined to check it out the next time I had a few free minutes.</p>

<p>After dinner tonight, I stopped by the bookstore to check out A Pattern Language.  The introduction talks about the Timeless Way of Building as the metabook (my words) of Pattern Language and how they really aren't separable: one provides the context, the other provides the words.   Timeless Way was on the shelf next to it, so I picked it up and read the introduction.  I was mesmerized. People don't write that eloquently, myself not excluded, any longer.</p>

<p>There was a powerful quote in the first chapter, and one that I find ironic giving the state of design patterns and refactoring in programming.</p>

<blockquote><p>But though this method [of defining architecture through patterns] is precise, it cannot be used mechanically.  <em>Page 12</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I couldn't help but think of all of the tools that enable refactoring. How we've tried to reduce patterns into reproducible macros and missed the spirit. It's too bad, really. I think a proper understanding of design patterns, be they of the structure of the code or the interface to it, can lead to <em>much</em> better code.</p>

<p>I ordered a copy tonight (couldn't pass up the $25 savings by having Amazon ship it) and plan on devouring it.  I'm sure there'll be plenty of notes on my <a href="http://readernaut.com/tswicegood/books/0195024028/the-timeless-way-of-building/">Readernaut</a> page as I work through it.</p>
