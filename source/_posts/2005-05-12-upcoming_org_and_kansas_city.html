title: Upcoming.org and Kansas City
---
<p>I just "discovered" <a href="http://upcoming.org/user/14676/">Upcoming.org</a> today.  I've known about it for some time, but I never really spent any time exploring it.  I've gone about adding all sorts of events to the <a href="http://upcoming.org/metro/us/mo/kc/">Kansas City metro</a>.  </p>

<p>If you pay any attention to the column on the right side of my web site, you'll see a new "<em>upcoming in kc</em>" section - that's being generated by entries on Upcoming.  So go <a href="http://upcoming.org/register/">sign-up</a> for an account and <a href="http://upcoming.org/add/event/89/">add the events</a> you know about.  With enough people adding an event or two a week, we could have all of the goings on in Kansas City covered.</p>

<p>Oh - and if you'd like to display what's "upcoming in kc" on your site, just leave a comment and I'll send you the code.  Right now it requires a bit of technical know-how to make it happen, but if there's enough interest I could make a widget that you could just copy and paste into your site.</p>
