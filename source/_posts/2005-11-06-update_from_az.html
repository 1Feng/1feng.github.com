<p>Well, I've been meaning to do this all week - time just hasn't cooperated.  I'm in Fountain Hills now.  The weather out here has been great, and I've gotten in a few great rides since I've been out here.  My apartment is still a disaster... I intended to work on it a bit yesterday, but after a little over five hours (yes, as in 300 minutes) on my road bike in the morning, I decided I would just take it easy for the day so that makes today's project a bit of cleaning up around here.</p>

<p>Note to self: just because the mountains are over there, doesn't always mean you have to go over there :)</p>
