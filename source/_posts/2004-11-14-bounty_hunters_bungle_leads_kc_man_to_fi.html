title: Bounty hunters' bungle leads KC man to file lawsuit
---
<p>You know, there are a lot of stupid laws on the books.  It seems that some of the laws that would just seem common sense are left out.</p>

<p>Did you know that there is little or no recourse if a bounty hunter "arrests" you <strike>can</strike> because they think you're someone else?  That's the case:</p>

<blockquote><p>Without legal pressure,  Benson said, ?Nobody is going to take responsibility for this.?</p></blockquote>

<p>"Benson" refers to Arthur A. Benson II, an attorney representing Richard Allen Sexton.  According to the <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/10169288.htm?1c">Star</a>, Sexton was mistaken for Richard <em>Alan</em> Sexton and arrested by a band of bounty hunters.  His recourse?  Nothing really.  There's no law holding bounty hunters liable for mistaking someone's identity.</p>

<p>Seems ludicrous...</p>
