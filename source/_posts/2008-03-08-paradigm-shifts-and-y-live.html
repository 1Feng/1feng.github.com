title: Paradigm shifts and Y! Live
---
<p>As a growing person, we should go through paradigm shifts regularly.  We don't, but we should.  I just had one tonight.  My sister <abbr title="instant message">IM</abbr>'d this evening and I started to tell her about the new paint I've got up in the office along with the new drapes I hung today.  As I got ready to type, I thought, "man, if she only had video IM."  Then I thought again, "oh wait, <a href="http://live.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Live</a>!"  (yes, I do think in hyperlinks)</p>

<p>Through <a href="http://live.yahoo.com/tswicegood/">my channel</a>, I gave her a quick tour of the office with the new paint color and the drapes in pretty much real-time with <strike>no</strike>, little fuss.  I had an issue where their UI was telling me that I wasn't broadcasting but it actually was.  Not knowing when the cameras are rolling could lead to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVynnbx1Xsc">all kinds of snafus</a>.</p>
