title: On the job front
---
<p>Lots of people have been asking about the job front and I'm happy to report that this past week I joined on as the lead developer at a locale design/development company, <a href="http://www.northland-advertising.com/">Northland Advertising</a>.  It will be a fun opportunity to shape their code as they start to move toward becoming a development company focusing on tools that help set their clients apart from their competition.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a company in Flag that was looking for a top shelf developer.  Turns out I'm not the only professional in the world that wants to make a living in the mountains here in Flagstaff.</p>

<p>On the "wish it was my job front", I still haven't seen the full results for <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/01/29/first_farce_of_the_year_mcdowell_meltdow">last week's marathon</a>, but I do have my final number from last week's marathon.  19th!  Ouch.  Looks like there were a lot more to that field than I realized.  Oh well, it's still January.  I have plenty of time to get fast. :-)</p>
