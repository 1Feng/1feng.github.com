title: An Alternative to Zend?
---
<p>I can't believe I haven't seen this on <a href="http://planet-php.org/">planet-php</a>, but um... did everyone miss that <a href="http://www.projectzero.org/blog/index.php/2008/03/29/sugarcrm-running-on-project-zero/">Project Zero</a> is now running SugarCRM?</p>

<div class="videoblock"><object data="http://www.youtube.com/v/deAUxj8tSaI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/deAUxj8tSaI"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param></object></div>

<p>Am I the only one that's thinking a non-Zend Engine PHP might be kind of cool?  Maybe I'm biased since I use a lot of <a href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/">Jython</a> in my day job scripting <a href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/">The Grinder</a>, but hooking a dynamic language into the JVM is pretty cool.  Imagine not having to use tools like memcached 'cause all you need for a cache that's not mission critical is to instantiate a HashTable object.</p>

<p>I definitely hope IBM has plans beyond the commercial WebSphere sMash.  More interpreters is definitely a good thing.  Hopefully some others will take the cue and get PHP on the DLR (I'm looking at you <a href="http://elizabethmariesmith.com/">Liz</a>).</p>
