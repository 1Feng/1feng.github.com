<p>Wow... some days you just don't have any mojo working for ya.  Started out an SSH server I needed to access was being flaky.  Shoot an email off to the guy who needs to look at it.  In the meantime the thought crosses my mind "hmm... I wonder if <a href="http://www.beryl-project.org">Beryl's</a> working any better now...  Install that and find out I need to upgrade X11.  Just a friendly FYI, don't do it.  An hour and a half later, I finally got X to start up again.  The server's still flaky - it works for a few, then it doesn't, then works, then it drops my connection in the middle of something, etc., etc.</p>

<p>And now... the <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/06/15/holy_lenter_favorite_expletivegl_enterg">dreaded concrete men</a> are back.  At least this time there's only one cutter going instead of two.</p>
