title: They're going to blow up the moon!
---
<p>
Ok, I knew it!  <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut.com</a> is a secret society where plans for the destruction of the human race are hatched!  It was enough for <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> to invade the very way in which information is gathered, no...  They had to setup a secret society with the front of being a "friendly" network.  Fiendly might be more like it!</p>

<p>
Someone going by the name of "<a href="http://stevedupont.com/">Steve</a>" on Orkut has proposed that we blow up the moon by way of the world's nuclear stockpile!  This action, which has garnered much interest from "creative" types seems to be gathering steam.  I fear before this post becomes public, a nuclear payload bent on destroying the tide stabilizer of the Earth may already be in transist to our little solar neighbor.  Please, advise all you know!</p>
