title: 365 days of cycling
---
<p>Today I lose my record of a perfect year of cycling.  I woke up this morning with a slightly sore throat, so you win body.  I know when you push back you mean business, so I'll take today off - maybe tomorrow too.</p>

<p>I'm fine now I think, but my body was getting a little worse for wear with 6 straight days with anywhere between 60 minutes to 5 hours in the saddle with over 120 miles under my belt.  Not a ton, especially compared to some of my previous riding habits, but quite a bit comparied to <em>recent</em> riding habits - especially when you consider over 1/3 is off road and all but 15 or 20 miles on the road was climbing miles.</p>
