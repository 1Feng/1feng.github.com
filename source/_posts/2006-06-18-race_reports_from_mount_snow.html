title: Race reports from Mount Snow?
---
<p>There were only <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/photos.php?id=/photos/2006/jun06/NORBA_3_06/NORBA_3_062/gallery-NORBA_3_062">three pictures</a> taken at this weekend's Mount Snow so far and only one of an actual racer.  Folks in Vermont don't believe in cameras apparently.  Come on guys, this is crazy...  A some results and a handful of pictures would be nice.</p>

<p>I know what <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=mtb/2006/jun06/NORBA_3_06/NORBA_3_062">you do</a>.  The new Epics are around 19 pounds?!  Geez, that thing's got to be a rocket.  Looking at the podium, seems to be working for #1 and #2.</p>

<p>It also came out that <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/mtb.php?id=news/2006/jun06/jun17mtbnews">Mount Snow</a> (scroll down) will host the US National Championships for the next two years.  I wonder why they're doing two in a row?  Seems like they'd mix it up a bit.  Guess this means I'll be in Vermont in July the next two years.</p>
