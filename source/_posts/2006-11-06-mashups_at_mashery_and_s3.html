title: Mashups at Mashery and S3
---
<p>Wow - what a weekend.  I ran out yesterday for lunch and after I came back I grabbed my keys and went to check the mail when Meg reminded me that the mail doesn't run on Sundays.  Working on weekends is definitely not my favorite way to spend a weekend, but it paided off.  <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>, my new company, is officially up at running.  The site went live some time after midnight Pacific time last night, and we've already got <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/06/mashery-api-management-service-is-open-for-business/">some</a> <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=3885">press</a> along with a handful of links starting to appear under the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/mashery">mashery</a> tag on del.icio.us.</p>

<p>One thing that did happen was my release of <a href="http://solarphp.org/wiki/Projects/Domain51#Domain51_Service_Amazon_S3">Domain51_Service_Amazon_S3</a> adapter for Solar (see <a href="http://mail.killersoft.com/pipermail/solar-talk/2006-November/001968.html">announce</a>).</p>
