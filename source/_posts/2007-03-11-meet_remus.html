title: Meet Remus

<p>I learned this lesson a long time ago...  You don't "just look" at dogs.</p>

<p>I saw him yesterday when we had Tig getting his shots.  After some thinking about it last night and this morning, we decided to head out and see how he acted one-on-one.  He's a big puppy (and by big, I mean 70 pounds).  I decided that with the money I would be spending at the national opener in a few weeks, I could get a dog, and have a lot more to bring home.  :-D</p>

<p>He's already used to being around other dogs and is fine and was great at the pet store today with the other dogs and people that were hanging out.  I'm sure with a little work, he's going to be a great mountain bike companion when I'm out for a spin.</p>
