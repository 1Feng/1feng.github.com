title: Why start Yet Another Framework?
---
<p>There's been <a href="http://killersoft.com/randomstrings/2007/02/16/rails-free-living/">tons</a> of (sometimes) <a href="http://www.gravitonic.com/blog/archives/000359.html">heated</a> debate over starting frameworks in PHP.  Apparently, <a href="http://www.planet-php.net/?start=10">Planet PHP</a> picked up my post from nearly 6 weeks ago announcing Pipes and posted it as a new announcement.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the general concensus has been "why start something?  why not just help out?"  Well, my answer can pretty much be summed in <a href="http://forum.mootools.net/topic.php?id=1692&amp;replies=13#post-7994">Valerio's response</a> to my Mootools patch from last week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>tswicegood: very nice experiment.</p>

<blockquote><p>Any thoughts, ideas? Valerio, is this something you see a reasonable to include in Mootools? </p></blockquote>

<p>No, unfortunately not, I have no intention of doing something like it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I'm left with the option of "pick[ing] another framework", forking Mootools, or starting yet another javascript framework.  Personally, I have no interest in starting a javascript framework.  Too much work and it's not an area that I have a tremendous amount of expertise in.</p>

<p>I am actively considering forking Mootools, though.  I personally really enjoy it.  It's a good, lightweight framework that jives with my development style.  The only thing I want is a namespaced version of it, which I have developed and offered as a patch and had summarily rejected.  If I fork it, it'll just be keeping up with releases with all of the goodies included.  I figure that's got to be useful to anyone else who wants their Mootools code to be testable with Selenium, so...</p>
