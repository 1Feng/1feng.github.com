title: Quick list of thanks
---
<p>Thanks to all of the friends and family and such who've been so supportive.  There's a lot of people who would get a "you want to go spend two weeks racing bikes?" from those around them.  Thankfully, I don't have those people around me.</p>

<p>And a special thanks to Meg for helping keep my apartment under control while I was gone.</p>
