title: Is today a holiday?
---
<p>Oh man... I'm spending too much time in front of a computer.  So I knew today was President's Day, but I had no idea we had the day off.  I felt bad for getting such a late start this morning, but was well on my way to making up.  Got some emails off, to which I hadn't heard responses, got some data generating for a large load test I'm working up, and then it dawned on me.  No one but the remote folks were online.  And they were mostly away.</p>

<p>A quick check of the holiday list, and <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/">we</a> do observer President's Day.  So I think that means I just accrued another half day of <abbr title="paid time off">PTO</abbr>. ;-)</p>
