title: Have you ever walked your bike on a pale moon night?
---
<p>I now have!</p>

<p>Happened to me last night.  <a href="http://bikelights.com/Products/Arc.htm">L&amp;M ARC's</a> will cut to half power at 60 seconds to go.  1:11 (I wasn't on a fully battery) in to my ride last night, I'm going along at pretty good pace through the TNT trail (about where the southern most T-N-T is on the map) on my way out to the car and boom - my light dims.  I was only about 15 minutes away from the car via the trail, and thankfully the moon was shinning 'cause I didn't have any backup light.  It's amazing how much of an effect clouds have on moon light.  It was starting to get partly cloudy toward the end of the ride, so I got to see the full effect of it.  If you're out there over the next few days and see some footprints that look like <a href="http://www.sidiusa.com/mtbs/images/mtbs-big/2005_dominator5lor_blackbla.jpg">Sidi's</a> with <a href="http://www.sidiusa.com/parts-access/index.html">toe spikes</a>, that's me! :)</p>

<p>I'll be headed to the store real soon to by an LED headlamp :)  Any suggestions?</p>
