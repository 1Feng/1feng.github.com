Had a good week at 2011's version of [tek][].  Thanks to [Marco Tabini][] and
his whole crew for putting together another great conference this year.  I
haven't professionally developed in PHP for several years now, but still
consider this a must attend conference.  This was my 4th year.  The people and
the content make it worth attending, even though I'm mostly doing Python work
these days.

I gave two talks this year, both on Git.  Both talks went well, but my advanced
Git talk needs some tweaking so I can get it in at an hour.  I always plan too
much material when I first give it, so it needs a little more taken out.

As promised, I am going to get both talks online over the next week.  Each of
the repositories we walked through in the advanced talk are going to be posted
to GitHub in their "before" state that you can play with them.  They also
include `README` files that explain what you're doing and how to do it.

I've already posted my [amending][] and [rebasing][] repositories.  You can
search [my github][] for `pres.` to see all of the repositories.  I'll post
again once I have them all up.

One of the more interesting evenings this year was a late-night hackathon that
involved two 5 gallon kegs from [Jason Sweat's][] personal stash.  I went to
bed early'ish, but got this image emailed to me around 1:30.  I'm told whiskey
fueled its creation. :-)
