<p>This just popped up... And <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/flashai.htm">Drudge</a> is reporting the same thing. Drudge's actually poaching the entire article, word-for-word from <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-01/04/content_405831.htm">ChinaDaily</a>... I guess their copyrights don't hold up when they cross the Pacific...</p>
