<p>Went for the first ride last night.  I was hesitant with the new shock.  25% sag seemed a bit high to me and when I got out on the road riding over to the perserve it seemed to bob a lot.  Once I got on the  trail though, I didn't notice it at all.  Actually, using the o-ring as a guide, I could probably increase the sag a bit and still be fine as I didn't even make it 75% of the way into the travel.  It weighs in approx. 27.5, which is where my other one was at so Fisher didn't change up the frame weight.</p>
