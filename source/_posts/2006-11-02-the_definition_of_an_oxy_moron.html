<p><code>$secretKey = $_REQUEST['secretKey'];</code></p>

<p>Ok, to you non-programmers that read my site, that will make no sense to you, but you programmer types who know anything about <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> will know exactly what that means: that key is anything but secret.</p>

<p>So where'd I find this gem?  Oh, nowhere in particular, except the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=126&amp;categoryID=47">example page for PHP</a>!  The code in question is not a major issue; it is just a proof of concept after-all.  To be fair the README does say "<em>Note that this program should only be run on a secure server owned by you...</em>", but still.  This is an example that people are going to use to build code off of, so why not do things the correct way?</p>
