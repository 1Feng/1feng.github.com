title: It's about the story, stupid! (non-profits online)

<p>Originally posted over at the horribly designed <a href="http://travis.domain51.com/">travis.domain51.com</a> (see what happens when you give a programmer CSS access), I thought I'd share this post here too since that blog is just getting underway.</p>
<hr />
<p>It truly is a shame that <a href="http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/">so</a> <a href="http://www.akshayatrust.org/">many</a> <a href="http://watercredit.org/">amazing</a> <a href="http://www.chfinternational.org/">non</a>-<a href="http://www.childrensaidsociety.org/">profits</a> are hidden behind horribly thought out websites. &nbsp;Most of these sites deluge their visitors with information, even though great sites such as <a href="http://charitynavigator.org/">Charity Navigator</a> exist to provide raw statistics and facts about non-profits. &nbsp;The problem is that most non-profits are missing the point. &nbsp;Their websites are there to tell a story.</p>
<p>Let me say it again: a non-profit's website is there to tell a story. &nbsp;Nothing else.</p>
<p>People are natural story tellers and are drawn to an authentic story. &nbsp;Each of the websites linked to above have an amazing story behind them just waiting to be unleashed. &nbsp;A story that engages their visitors and potential donors. &nbsp;A story that sticks with them while they navigate their life the next few days. &nbsp;A story that ends with another beginning. &nbsp;One the visitor is a part of&mdash;where they help chose the ending by getting involved and helping that non-profit reach its goals, whether those goals are getting girls back to school to defeat the spiral of poverty in East Africa; feeding the abandoned, mentally ill of India; or helping people afford water while lifting themselves out of poverty.</p>
<p>When I left <a href="http://ning.com/">Ning</a> a year ago this day I set out to figure out how I could increase my impact on the world. &nbsp;Through a series of&nbsp;fortuitous&nbsp;events, I ended up working with non-profits, helping them tell their story online. &nbsp;I need to make sure I remember that.</p>
<p>Everyone has a story to tell. &nbsp;These organizations are trying to change the world with theirs, and <a href="http://domain51.com/">we're</a> there to help them.</p>
