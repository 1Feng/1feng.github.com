title: What google thinks of me...
---
<p>I haven't done one of my Google posts in awhile.  I've got some good ones today though.</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=striving%20to%20attain%20a%20oneness%20in%20Christ">striving to attain a oneness in Christ</a> - I guess someone was trying to figure out how to be a Christian.  When you search Google for <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/02/13/religious_beliefs_of_a_pseudo_intellectu">striving to attain a oneness in Christ</a> I'm number 6 out of 18,800 pages.  Does this mean I've figured it out?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=adultry%2Blegal+definition&amp;start=20">adultry+legal definition</a> - Umm... ok?  I'm number 22 out of 3,790 possible results with <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5">this post which is apparently on adulty+legal definition</a> in some way.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=running+a+restaurant+with+my+dad+stinks&amp;start=10">running a restaurant with my dad stinks</a> - this one makes no sense, apprently, my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php?cat=20">Personal</a> category has something to do with this?  I guess someone was looking to vent...  If you come back anonymous Mac user, feel free to explain why running a restaurant with your dad sticks.</li></ul>

<p>Of course, there's also the standard "cycling legs", "cycling shaved legs", "Rick Mathes", etc., that I get a ton of.</p>

<p>In another Google area, my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/18/what_s_my_google_number">Google number</a> is still climbing.  I'm at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22">13,100</a> currently.  Several thousand of those are because of my involvement in <a href="http://b2evolution.net">b2evolution.net</a>, however; there's a link to my site on the default installation.  When I filter out those results I'm at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22%20-%22Travis%20Swicegood%20Hosting%22">5,190</a>.  Not too shabby when you consider that 14 months ago when I <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/18/what_s_my_google_number">first started tracking my number</a> I only had 594.</p>
