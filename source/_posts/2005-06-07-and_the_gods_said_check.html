title: And the gods said, check...
---
<p>You ever have one of those moments where you say something almost at random, "yeah, I'd do &lt;insert what you'd do&gt; if only &lgt;insert condition&gt;"?  Sure you have.  "Yeah, I'd go sky diving if only it wasn't so expensive" or "Yeah, I could be a pro cyclist if only I had to the time to devote to training."  Ok, ok - so the last one is wishful thinking on my part, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>You know how sometimes you say it to the wrong person or say it out loud and the barrier you had is almost instantly removed (instantly being in geological time)?  Sort of like the gods saying "Check.  Your move."  Almost a dare if you will.  Well, I had one of those today.  I'll elaborate more as everything gets worked out, but it could mean big changes at Casa del Travisimo.</p>
