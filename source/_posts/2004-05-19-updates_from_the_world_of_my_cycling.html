title: Updates from the world of my cycling
---
<p>
I'm going to start keeping track of some of my cycling adventures here.  I know there's a whole slew of people who are waiting impatiently for these, so here we go.</p>

<p>
Last night (Tuesday), I did my first group ride in the rain here in KC.  In all honesty, riding for two hours in on and off rain here was better than 15 minutes of rain in El Paso!  The roads in EP get nasty when it rains, grime and gunk and oily stuff that you don't even want to ask what is... just plain ugly.  Here, the roads are kept pretty clean because of all of the rain we get.</p>

<p>
Anyhow, turned out to be a pretty good ride.  I met Mike from over at <a href="http://www.cowtowncycling.com/">Cowtown Cycling</a>, who turns out to be the webmaster over there.  We had a nice visit after <a href="http://cowtowncycling.com/ipw-web/gallery/2004SpringFling4/DSC02661">Ed</a> decided to turn up the juice.  Mike told me to email 'em about joining, that they're always looking for new riders/racers.  I just don't know if I could pull on a <a href="http://cowtowncycling.com/ipw-web/gallery/2004SpringFling4/DSCF0597">cow-print jersey</a> every weekend :)</p>

<p>
It was a good ride, though.  We averaged just over 20 mph for the whole ride.  It would have been better had me and Mike not sat up and talked for 15 minutes.  I'm getting my legs back under, that's for sure.  The only thing that's throwing me right now is that it takes between 30 and 45 minutes of riding for me to get warmed up.  I guess I'm just getting old...</p>
