title: "2008: A retrospective"
---
<p>One year gone.  As I'm sure most of these types of posts say, this year's been crazy.  I got <a href="http://blog.accordingtomegan.com/">married to my best friend</a>, took a job at <a href="http://www.ning.com/">a great start-up</a>, <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/pragmatic-version-control-using-git">wrote a book</a>, and bought a house!  Talk about a banner year.</p>

<p>I discovered a lot about myself.  One, writing on my blog isn't as much fun when writing becomes work.  I thought I would blog a lot more about the book writing experience, but after putting in an 8 (or 12) hour day at my day job and spending 2 - 4 hours writing after that, writing here wasn't the release it once was.</p>

<p>The book's over though, so now I've got no good excuse.  My <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> is full of ideas for blog posts.  This next year, I'm going to get some of those down on "paper" to share.  Of course, those posts are in addition to <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">the copious amount of posts</a> I make on Twitter.</p>

<p>Back in January, the <a href="http://traviscline.com/">other Travis</a> and I started up <a href="http://lawrence.ning.com/group/programmers">Lawrence Programmers</a>.  It's a language agnostic group of geeks.  We started with a monthly schedule, but didn't find out groove until the summer.  Lawrence Programmers Drinking Nights (LPDN) are a weekly get together to grab food and some beverages and BS about geek stuff.  It's been great getting to know the local geeks better.</p>

<p>There's all sorts of other things too.  Didn't spend nearly enough time on my bike, but got Meg hooked on hers.  Contributed ideas to a lot of software projects and spent some time playing with on my own stuff.  Learned Erlang and Python well enough to hack in both.  And I'm sure in my drug-induced stupor (God bless cold medicine), I've barely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>I've got a few new things planned for 2009.  I'll fill you in on them as they come to fruition.  In the meantime, I leave you with this <a href="http://lawrence.com/podcasts/punditocracy/2008/dec/30/2008-year-wouldnt-die/">auditory year-in-review</a> from the guys over at <a href="http://lawrence.com">Lawrence.com</a>  A note of warning: it is a little raw in some areas, so its not for those offended by such things as cursing or rick-rolls.</p>

<p>Happy 2009!</p>
