title: Update on Coast 2050 website
---
<p>Well, it looks like someone found out how to re-enable the <a href="http://www.coast2050.gov">Coast 2050</a> website.  As you'll remmeber, I <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/09/03/the_memory_hole_beckons">posted about it being taken down</a> this past weekend.</p>

<p>It still looks like the mainstream media hasn't caught on. Google is reporting 27 articles wih the phrase <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22coast%202050%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn">"Coast 2050"</a> in it, while <a href="http://technorati.com/search/%22Coast+2050%22">Technorati has 60</a>.</p>
