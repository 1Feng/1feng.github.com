title: Catching a ride to the San Francisco PHP Meetup
---
<p>Anyone headed from around Cupertino to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=9680776460">SF PHP Meetup</a> next Thursday night?  I'm going to be in town for <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/events/sugarcon/">SugarCON</a>, but was hoping to make it up for the evening.  If you're going and don't mind a hitch-hiker, leave me a comment or ping me on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=612676290">Facebook</a>...</p>
