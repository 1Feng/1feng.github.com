<p><img src="http://www.travisswicegood.com/media/John-Kerry-in-Kansas-City.jpg" border="0" alt="John Kerry signs an autograph for a supporter" class="imgRight" />And as if getting registered to vote wasn't enough... I got to see Democratic Presidential Nominee, Senator <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/">John Kerry</a> face-to-face tonight!  He ate at the <a href="http://www.herefordhouse.com/">Hereford House</a> in the Crossroads district.  As I was going back to my car, the police said he'd be out within the next 5 minutes.  5 turned in to 15, but I still got to meet him and wish him luck - as I would Nadar, Bush, or any other candidate for President.</p>

<p>My sister, who happened to be in town tonight on a surprise visit got to ask him about his plans for military.  On <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/">her and her husband's blog</a>, she's been keeping track of some of the issues she's having with the military.  She asked the Senator what his plans were for military pay - did he plan on raising it.  He said yes, "and I'll tell you what else I'm going to do."  He then launched in to the increase the military, do away with "these crazy deployment schedules" and his normal stuff.  He talked with her for about 10 seconds, probably the longest time he took going through the line to answer any one in particular question.</p>

<p>She <a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/index.php?title=what_are_the_chances&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">just posted about it on her blog</a>.  She also has a great picture I took of her talking with him - well, it's kind of blurry, but I shot it in the middle of the night on a dark street.  She's kind of long winded (runs in the family I guess), so it should be pretty detailed explaining what she thought of their encounter.</p>
