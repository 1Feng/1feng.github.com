<p>Sorry Eric, but this is just too damn funny...</p>

<blockquote><p>I DON'T KNOW WHO TRAVIS SWICEGOOD IS AND AT THIS POINT DON'T CARE TO KNOW. I ATTEMPTED IN GOOD FAITH TO POST A COMMENT TO HIS SITE ON RICK MATHES AND HAD THAT SILLY QUESTION ...WHAT COLOR IS BLACK....TO RESPOND TO....DID NOT REALIZE THIS IS A JOKE SITE FOR BIZARE WARPED SENSE OF HUMORS. YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AND ME PERSONALLY. GET ON YOUR BIKE AND RIDE INTO THE SUNSET AND LEAVE COMPUTERS FOR THOSE WHO ARE QUASI INTELLIGENT. THANK YOU</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, his original email was entirely in caps-lock, and yes, this dude emailed me pissed off that he couldn't figure out what color black was so he could respond to one of my responses to Rick Mathes (search Google for it and look for my name on the first page).  Now, I know <a href="http://mcturge.blogspot.com/">Matt</a> takes issue with that question stating that (and technically, correctly) black is devoid of all color, so is therefore not a color, but wow.  </p>

<p>The sad part, I actually responded to him earlier in the week and told him he was trying to make this too hard and that black is, well black.  </p>

<p>This "color" is devoid of all color and generally referred to as black.  </p>

<p>*ring ring ring* Alex, what is Black?  </p>

<p>Correct!  </p>

<p>Can I have Blatently Obvious to Chimpanzees for $200?  </p>

<p>Two of this, the first non-zero even number equal four.</p>

<p>*ring ring ring* What is two?  </p>

<p>Correct, and you've won the right to call yourself the homo sapien!</p></blockquote><p>At least he was courteous.  He did say thank you, or at least yell it anyway.</p>
