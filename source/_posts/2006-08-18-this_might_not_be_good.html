title: This might not be good...
---
<p>Last night after I left Barnes and Noble, I noticed the air seemed a little cold even though it was in the upper 90s.  On the way home, I got a cough.  Not the "I swalloed wrong" kind, but the "something's in my chest" kind.  By the time I went to sleep it had progressed into something bigger.  Vicks and vitamin time.</p>

<p>This morning, I woke up from an awesome dream, but my upper chest feels like someones pushing down on it and I've still got the cough.  Not good...  And the weekend of the Signal Peak race in Silver City of all times!  That's one of the more fun races in the series.</p>
