title: Cleaning out my buddy list
---
<p>Ok, this is ridiculous.  I have 158 people in my buddy list.  There are a few in there that I haven't talked with for over half a decade! (yes, I've had an AOL Instance Messenger account for <em>that</em> long).</p>

<p>So, I'm cleaning it out.  This huge list of people that are constantly going on and offline is taking up screen real estate and serving as a destraction.  I'm not going to do a full removal of everybody, but if I don't remember what face/name goes with the screen name or the time that's elapsed since we last chatted is counted in years, you're probably going to get cut.  If you're afraid you might not make the cut and want to stay on my buddy list, show me an <a href="aim:goim?screenname=tswicego&amp;message=Hi.+Are+you+there?">im</a> and let me know.</p>
