title: American in yellow!

<p><img class="imgRight" src="http://www.cyclingnews.com/photos/2006/tour06/tour061/DV84299_200.jpg" />Hincapie's in yellow!  Now, is Discovery going to try to keep it?  Or give it away and just use this as a shot over the bow of the other teams, or what?  So many possible tactics from here...</p>

<p>Speaking of Hincapie, am I the only one that finds <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/photos/2006/tour06/tour061/IMG_0873.jpg">this picture</a> mildly disturbing?  I mean, I know 12 years on the pro circuit will make your body adapt in ways that most people's never will (just look at <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3587/1328/1600/PICT0010.1.jpg">Ned's 50 year old legs</a>), but still... wow.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated note, I hate Windows.  My computer is booted into Windows right now because I was loading my Forerunner data into MotionBased.  I got this post complete, but was looking at another site and the browser quits.  Ugh...</p>
