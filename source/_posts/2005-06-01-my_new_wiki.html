title: My new wiki
---
<p>For all of you who can't get enough about me, I am now running a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Awiki">wiki</a> at <a href="http://wiki.travisswicegood.com">wiki.travisswicegood.com</a>.  </p>

<p>This will become a repository of information that I collect that is better presented in a structured way instead of in reverse chronological order.  One thing I hope to work on moving soon are all of my <a href="http://wiki.travisswicegood.com/index.php/Reading_Notes">reading notes</a>.  They will make much more sense presented in a wiki format than a blog.</p>

<p>As you might notice, there's no way for you to edit my wiki.  Unlike public wikis such as <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, my wiki is going to be closed.  I may open up an editor account to allow a few friends and family to help edit out the typos I'm sure to put on it, but other than that it will remained closed.</p>

<p>Anyhow, enough writing... time for my beauty rest. :)</p>
