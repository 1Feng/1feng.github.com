title: MTS07 - Windows Mobile in a Nutshell

<p>They have the .NET Micro Framework which covers small devices (watches, etc.) that work on under 300k.  Windows Embedded which works on a larger devices and is broken down into three parts.  Windows Mobile is built on top of Windows CE (one of the Embedded packages).</p>

<p>They've had a hands-on demo with a bunch of mobile devices.  I managed to kill one in bluetooth - it hung while searching for other devices.</p>

<p>As far as development goes - the usual suspects.  Flash, Java, AJAX via Pocket IE, etc.  Some of the live demos included things like "Women grows nipple on feet" and something about jesuit priests and sex.</p>

<p>The best quote: "Umm... I guess I should sanitize my demo a little bit." :-)</p>

<p>This is the second presentation that's had "there's more things coming, but I can't tell you yet."  Sounds like they haven't got the timing thing down yet.</p>
