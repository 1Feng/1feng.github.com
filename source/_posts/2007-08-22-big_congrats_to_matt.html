title: Big congrats to Matt
---
<p><a href="http://mcturge.blogspot.com/2007/08/day-in-sage.html">Matt</a> just took 1st in SS at <a href="http://www.24hoursinthesage.com/">24 Hours in the Sage</a>.  And took 3rd overall after leading the race into the night.  That dude's on fire this year and representing <a href="http://bigwheelracing.org">BWR</a> big time this year.  (His site's giving me an error right now, but I'm sure it'll be back online as soon as Google figures it out...)</p>
