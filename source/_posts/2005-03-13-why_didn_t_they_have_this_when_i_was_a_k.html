Ok.  So it qualifies me as a dork, but it's the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/product.asp?p=10143&amp;cn=4&amp;d=5&amp;t=3">Death Star II</a> for crying out loud!  I think Lego made a conscious decision when I was younger to wait until I (and by "I", I mean my generation) had more disposable income and release some very cool sets.</p>

<p>I wonder how many weeks' allowance it would have taken to pony up the $300?</p>
