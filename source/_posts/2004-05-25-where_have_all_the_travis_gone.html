title: Where have all the Travis' gone?

I'm still here, just been busy.  I'm talking with <a href="http://mosdoc.mamboserver.com/wakka.php?wakka=Andrew_Eddie&amp;v=ibc">Andrew Eddie</a> about a new project / task management software.  We're still trying to work out what it will be, but it looks like it will be powered off of the Mambo core and probably distributed as custom Mambo install.  Definitely some cool stuff.</p>

In other news, the California Supreme Court is <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/sfmarriages/">hearing a case on same-sex marriages</a> in San Francisco.  I listened to a portion of the debates this morning over lunch.  Riveting...  Well, it's better than the TV version of a court.  Plus these cases do more than effect the underlying story line of a series, there is actual effects to real people.  If you've never watched a Supreme Court case on TV, it's worth a watch.</p>
