title: New anti-spam measures
---
<p>I've added a new step to the commenting process which will hopefully allow me to re-enable a certain blog domain name for comments.  I've got a lot of cyclists who run blogs there, and I hate not being able to let them display links.</p>

<p>Hopefully, all of the spam I was getting was from automated sources.  If that's the case, this new question will eliminate all that and you guys can post links back to your sites.</p>
