title: Quick Update

<p>Never got those audio blog posts posting, and something weird happened when posting them, so they're not all on here...  Next time maybe.</p>

<p>A full report will come later, but didn't do much of anything in the road race.  Ended up finishing one place out of the money (5th, they paid four deep) in the street sprints.  Those are something else.  Won the Expert 19 - 29 for my first XC win of the season... scratch that.  That was my first XC win ever!  Wow, just dawned on me.</p>

<p>I did what I set out to do: win the XC and get in some good training in the road races.  All in all a good weekend of racing.</p>
