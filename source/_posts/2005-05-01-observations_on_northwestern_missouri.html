title: Observations on northwestern Missouri
---
<p>Yesterday I raced in the first race of the <a href="http://www.nebraskacycling.org/psycowpath">Psycowpath</a> series.  I know, I know... cheesy name, but I didn't name it.  The drive up to the race location - just south of Omaha - took me up I-29 through northwestern Missouri.  About 20 miles from the Iowa state line, I-29 gets out of the rolling hills and starts traveling along the side of the river bluffs.</p>

<p>It was something else to see how big of a swath the Missouri used to cut through that part of the country.  There were a few places where the bluffs were at least five miles apart.  Can you imagine a river swollen to five miles from side-to-side?  I guess it's the desert rat in me, but that's hard to comprehend.</p>
