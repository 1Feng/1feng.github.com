<p>"25% of all banking users have quit banking online while 22% have cut back."  I find that stat hard to believe.</p>

<p>Passport down more than a billion authentications a day?</p>

<p>"Thingification" - turning concepts into things.</p>

<p>This sounds like OpenID.  I'm not sure exactly how it differs.  I asked that question.  The difference is that if you go to Site X and say "I'm travisswicegood.com", Site X knows where I'm going for my identity.  It can then make a request to that, mimic it's behavior, and fool you into putting your password in there.  With CardSpace, Site X doesn't know anything about how you provided the identity to it.</p>

<p>Kim views CardSpace and OpenID as complimentary.</p>
