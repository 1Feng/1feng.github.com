<p>Please forgive me for the sin I am about to commit against my legs, for I know not what I am doing.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/pdfs/DeerValley_Course_MA.pdf">map</a> is up.  25 mile laps, with 8,800' of climbing each lap.  I can only pray that Todd from <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/index1.htm">Epic Rides</a> hasn't been whispering in their ears that it would take at least 3 laps to be a <em>real</em> endurance race.</p>

<p>Wow, surviving this race will make the Nationals course seem like a cake walk.</p>
