title: Had a bad day?  Go to eBay!
---
<p>I think you might have to be a cyclist to fully appreciate <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=7239659006">this</a>, but some times you just have a bad day and want to get rid of it all!</p>

<blockquote><p>EVERY THING YOU WILL EVER NEED TO PRETEND YOU ARE A PRO BIKE RACER.</p>

<p>Team car and bikes are included. </p>

<p>After two days at the GILA we have decided that everything must go.  This is all the TOP of the line stuff.  Everything is light as light gets. The sad thing it didn't help me from getting dropped.  SRM power meters for both bikes and laptop so when all else fails you can over analyze what went wrong.... this is everything you will ever need to pretend like you are a bike racer.  You don't have to even take the bikes off the car.  Just drive around town and talk about epic rides and SICK wattages.  Flash out the INCLUDED USCF LICENSE CAT  2 and talk about how you are about to apply for your upgrade to a 1 for your shot to win Nationals in JULY.</p></blockquote>
