I talk with a lot of people about NoSQL.  I've been following it pretty closely
for about 3 years now.  One of the things I often tell people who are trying to
wrap their heads around the concepts of NoSQL and what all of the data stores
mean is to go search for [Justin Sheehy][] and his [NoSQL East Talk][].

Then it dawned on me, why don't I just embed the video on my site?  Makes it
super easy for people to find ([travisswicegood.com/tags/riak][riak-tag]) and I don't
have to go searching for it.

So, here's what I consider one of the best talks to date on NoSQL.
