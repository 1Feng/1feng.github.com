title: Delicious API wrapper v0.3 for Solar released
---
<p>The last few days have given me an opportunity to work on <a href="http://mail.killersoft.com/pipermail/solar-talk/2006-October/001891.html">creating a wrapper</a> to the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/api/">API</a> for the <a href="http:solarphp.com">Solar</a> framework.  In my new job, there's a possibility that I'll be writing a few wrappers for various web services, so I figured I could use this little breather I've had to get some experience doing that.</p>

<p>So far, I haven't written anything of use for this, but I'm thinking I'm going to extend the Solar Bookmarks sample application to include saving all bookmarks to your internal bookmarks and del.icio.us, plus I want to implement the ability to go to del.icio.us and grab a copy of new items that were tagged for you by members of your network.  If you're interested in Solar, or web services, etc., <a href="https://svn.domain51.net/svn/d51Solar/tags/delicious/v0.3/">check out the code</a> and let me know what you think.  It does require <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http">pecl_http</a> to handle it's HTTP requests, though I may refactor that out in a later release.</p>
