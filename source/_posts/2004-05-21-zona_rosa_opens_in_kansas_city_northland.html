title: Zona Rosa opens in Kansas City Northland
---
<p>
Who would think that the opening of a newfangled and, as yet, uncompleted shopping center would cause a traffic jam?  Who would indeed.  I knew <a href="http://www.zonarosa.com/">Zona Rosa</a> was nearing completion and since I was in the neighborhood checking my P.O. Box, I thought I'd drive over and see what was going on.  Little did I know that it was now "<em>officially</em>" open.  The parking lot was a zoo, people were walking everywhere.  The line of traffic to get out of the place was horrible - only one lane leading into two turn lanes back toward the Interstate.  It was something else...</p>

I'm not really all that impressed by Zona Rosa.  Once the <a href="http://www.bn.com/">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> opens maybe I'll change my mind as at least then there will be something worth going to down there.  It really seems like a knock-off of the <a href="http://www.countryclubplaza.com/">Plaza</a>, a bad one at that.  The Plaza has a entrances and exits going every which way; Zona Rosa on the other hand has one, and tonight at least it was very congested.  The Plaza has big name stores galore; the biggest name at Zona Rosa is <a href="http://www.bn.com/">B&amp;N</a>.  It's definitely something interesting to have around, but I don't think it will be a place that will be on my "to visit" list when out-ot-town guests are in town for the weekend.</p>
