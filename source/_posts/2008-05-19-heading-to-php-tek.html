title: Heading to php|tek
---
<p>Yeah, I know... it's been a long time.  Life's been busy.  Between work, PHPT, the book, and my new scooter there's been little time for little else.  I've really got to take <a href="http://thenazg.blogspot.com/search/label/polyphasic">Chuck's lead</a> and give <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/05/10/can-someone-survive-on-2-hours-of-sleep-">polyphasic sleeping</a> a try.  Until then, I'll have to get by just making the occasional updates.</p>

<p>I've finished some last minute errand running before heading to <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">php|tek</a>.  Of course, I'll be <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">twittering</a> (if they can stabilize it - been horrible today).  Along with everyone else, I'll be tagging it with <a href="http://hashtags.org/tag/phptek/">#phptek</a>.  </p>

<p>I'll also be doing some in person recruiting, so if you're interested in working at SugarCRM, look me up.  In particular, there's an <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/index.php?option=com_jobs&amp;task=show&amp;id=113">opening on my team</a> working on all of the public facing SugarCRM sites.</p>
