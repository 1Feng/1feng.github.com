This may be premature, but it looks like I'm live with the new site design and
new blog engine.  The design is HTML5 (i.e., it looks great to me in Chrome,
not sure what it'll be like elsewhere) and the new engine is [jekyll][].

What does this mean for you, my loyal reader?  Not much, really.  I believe my
port is transparent.  

Actually, the only problem I'm seeing right now is related to [disqus][]---some
of my comments that I know are imported are not showing up yet.  I just dumped
nearly 2,000 comments into their system for this blog, so my guess is that it's
a caching issue and they'll catch up.  The comment count number are correct
inside their admin interface, so I know the comments are in their system
somewhere. :-)

If anything looks out of whack, please let me know.
