title: Why class inheritance sucks
---
<p>Bernard Sumption has a post titled <a href="http://www.berniecode.com/writing/inheritance/"><i>Inheritance is evil, and must be destroyed: part 1</i></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>All of the pain caused by inheritance can be traced back to the fact that inheritance forces 'is-a' rather than 'has-a' relationships. If class R2Unit extends Droid, then a R2Unit is-a Droid. If class Jedi contains an instance variable of type Lightsabre, then a Jedi has-a Lightsabre.</p>

<p>The difference between is-a and has-a relationships is well known and a fundamental part of OOAD, but what is less well known is that almost every is-a relationship would be better off re-articulated as a has-a relationship.</p></blockquote>

<p>I couldn't have said it better myself.  Remember that next time you type <code>extends</code> and re-think the implementation before taking the easy route.  Unless, of course, you just want to be like Java ;-)</p>
