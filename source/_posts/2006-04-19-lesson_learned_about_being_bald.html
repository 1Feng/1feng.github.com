title: Lesson learned about being bald

<p>Sunscreen is your friend.  It still doesn't hurt like a normal sunburn, but I have the pattern of a Pnuemo helmet on my head.  Sunday I went out for a road ride in the middle of the day and didn't wear any sort of cap under my helmet.  When I got out of the shower after the ride I noticed my head was awfully red, then it dawned on me.  Oops...</p>

<p>In other news, I'm one ride away from having as many rides in 2006 as I managed in 2005 and hitting the 100k vertical feet mark.  Tonight I'm climbing on the mountain bike, so I'm sure I'll get that in no problem.</p>
