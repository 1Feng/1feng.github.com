title: Greetings from Phoenix
---
<p>So I'm getting ready to pack up and check out of my hotel room this morning in Phoenix, and I notice I have complimentary, high-speed Internet.  One problem though, it's wired and I haven't carried around a network cable with my laptop in ages.  A quick call to the front desk, though, and I have Internet access.</p>

<p>I've posted a dump of the pictures I took yesterday <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/phoenix-from-july-30-31_photo-dump?page=1">in this album</a>.  Nearly all of them are from atop <a href="http://www.ci.phoenix.az.us/PARKS/hikesoth.html">South Mountain</a>.  There's some sweet <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/phoenix-from-july-30-31_photo-dump/dsc05228">looking singletrack</a> there, but unfortunately I don't have any of my bikes with me.  I guess I should get a plane carrier...  </p>
