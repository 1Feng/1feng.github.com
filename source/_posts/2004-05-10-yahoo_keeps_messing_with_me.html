title: Yahoo! keeps messing with me
---
<p>
I'm starting to get feed up with <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>.  They keep toying with me.  One minute I'm a hot commodity, the next I'm nowhere to be found.  I'm talking about the Yahoo! search for "Travis".  I've been as high as 3rd, and so low I couldn't even find myself.  The site that has been listed is <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws/">From the Crossroads</a>.</p>

<p>
What really got me is that for a few days, I was ousted by someone who had registerd the .com of my name and hadn't event put a site up.  The only references to "Travis" on the site were "<em>Welcome to your new website: insertdomain.com</em>".  Yahoo has now fixed their search algorithm to not include sites like that, but the constant r fluctuation just goes to show how under construction their search still is.</p>

<p>
In the meantime, this site should give me the ranking I desire.  Not only is my name prominently displayed on the site, it's the domain name.  So, keep an eye on <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sfp&amp;p=Travis">Yahoo!</a>, you're favorite <em>Travis</em> might just be showing up.</p>
