title: I'm king of the world...
---
<p>Ok, well not really, but I'm getting close.</p>

<p>It's geeky, I know, but from time to time I can't help but going to Google and Yahoo and putting in "Travis Swicegood" and seeing what happens.  Since I know you've been waiting all of 30 seconds to find out how I'm king of the world, here's the official results:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22">Google Number - 3,460</a></li>
<li><a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22">Yahoo Number - (make sure you're sitting down) 12,600</a></li></ul>

<p>Apparently, Yahoo likes me better.  Just to put these numbers in context.  <a href="http://blog.contentious.com/">Amy Gahran</a>'s Google/Yahoo #'s are 13,100 and 13,100; <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com">Lee LeFever</a>'s Google/Yahoo #s are 4,200 and 5,310.</p>

<p>So what's the secret of my success?  Welp, every time someone install<em class="edit">s</em> the <a href="http://www.b2evolution.net">b2evolution</a> blog and doesn't update their blog-roll, a link to me via "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%20Hosting%22">Travis Swicegood Hosting</a>" goes up.  For the real numbers, run <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22%20-%20%22Travis%20Swicegood%20Hosting%22">this Google search</a> and <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Travis%20Swicegood%22%20-%22Travis%20Swicegood%20Hosting%22">this Yahoo search</a>.  Neither of them are bad, but there's still a big gap.  It also shows how quickly Yahoo is gathering results on the Internet.</p>
