title: Time to be Cool Uncle Trav?

<p><a href="http://www.keepingupwithus.com/">Sarah</a> went in to the hospital this evening.  Right now it's just in the "let's make sure" stages, but I'm supposed to be getting a call as soon as they know something for sure.  I know she's ready to have this baby and has been for several weeks now.</p>

<p>Anyway, direct good thoughts her way...</p>
