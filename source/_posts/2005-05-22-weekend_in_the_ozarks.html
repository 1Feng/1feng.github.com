title: Weekend in the Ozarks
---
<p>Nothing like doing something productive on the weekend.  I spent the better part of mine with the <a href="http://www.earthriders.org/">guys from ERTA</a> working on the <a href="http://forums.earthriders.com/viewforum.php?f=18">trails at Lake of the Ozarks State Park (LoSP)</a>.  We still haven't got to benchcut the trails, we're still in a clearing mode.  Doug lead a few guy in building some creek crossings - and even managed to get one or two on the trail.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=define:naturalist">naturalist</a> of the state park doesn't want anyone riding the trail until it is "completed" and because she doesn't know what she's doing.  Trails need to be ridden in before they're finished so you can make sure you're building them in the right place. There were a few sections that I - err, I mean if I had been riding I would have seen needed to be moved about 6" - 12" to one side or the other to make sure follow the natural flow of the trail.  Since we're <em>not</em> riding the trails though it would be almost impossible to figure out that they were just a bit off. ;)</p>

<p>I've got some pictures of the trails that we were working on; I'll post 'em tomorrow.  I think the trails going to be killer once they're completed.  Talking with Posson, he's figuring on finishing it up sometime this fall or during the winter.  This means next year it'll be a great weekend destination for riding.</p>

<p>If you haven't had the opportunity to hang out with the guys from ER/ERTA, you've got to put it on your to-do list.  Saturday night's dinner was a riot.  Nothing like going into a family run restaurant when half of the family is <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/59/4/threesheetst.html">three sheets to the wind</a> and the other is sufferring a family crisis and trying to "manage" the drunken half of her family.  Throw in nine rowdy guys and you can imagine the fun that ensued.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm nearly three days behind on any personal correspondences now so if I owe you an email, know that you should be hearing from me you soon.  Also, on the ride down I had a very thought provoking few hours of conversation which has given me some fodder for writing.  Once I get a chance to hash out my thoughts, I'll post 'em.</p>
