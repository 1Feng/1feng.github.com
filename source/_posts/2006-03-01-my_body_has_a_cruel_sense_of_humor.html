title: My body has a cruel sense of humor
---
<p>So the first night I'm not in bed by 10:30 or so in over a week and my brain decides it needs to be fully operational by 6:30.  "No more sleep for you."  Top it off with sore muscles from my first upper body work out in at least 9 months.  Yup, today is going to be fun.</p>
