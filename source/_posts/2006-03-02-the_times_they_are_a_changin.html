title: The times, they are a changin'...
---
<p>I can tell just by my eating habits.  It's been getting warmer, and the foods of winter - heavier, greasier, etc. - just dont' seem as appealing.  Give me a sandwich and I feel better all day.  This might take some getting used to, because this change normally comes a month or so later for me.  I guess it's just the fact that it gets warmer here earlier in the year.</p>

<p>So for the last week I've had the flyer from the <a href="http://www.teambigbear.com/event_detail.php?event_id=139">Nova Desert Classic</a> sitting in front of me on my desk.  I've picked it up and looked it over a few times, and had come to the conclusion I wasn't going to race.  I know my current shape, and it's nowhere near racing Expert 25-29 at a national level race.  Even though this isn't a <abbr title="NORBA Championship Bike Series">NCBS</abbr> race this year, it'll attract a lot of top level people from around the region.  That and it's just a few weeks before Gallup.  A 3 day stage race followed by a brutal XC race the next week and then a 12 hour race makes me hurt to think about.</p>

<p>But today the fact that the Marathon race is part of the Norba series finally hit me.  So I started doing some looking into it.  In the Norba Marathon series, you have the Open/Pro division in men, then 19 - 29, 30 - 39, etc., through a 50+ division.  I've only witnessed one Norba marathon race and it was a 6 hour race without many racers.  With my curiousity peaked, I looked at the results from last year...</p>

<p>There wasn't a single racer in the 19 - 29 age group that raced more than one race the whole 7 race season!  First place was a 6 way tie among the 6 different first place winner of the season.  There was one race that no one even showed up for my age group.  And the guy who won the last race - against only one other racer I might add - won the title by default (tie breakers are determined by who finished higher in the latest race).  A check of the <a href="http://www.norbanationals.com/guide/marathon.shtml">calendar</a> this year shows that all the races are in the western half of the country with San Francisco (Sonoma on the 14th of July) being the furthest away.</p>

<p>I'm really thinking about giving it a shot this year.  I'm in no shape to win the Nova race right now, nor will I be in 3 weeks, but I could finish it.  If I can finish and keep myself healthy, the other races aren't that far away to go race in them.  It's not like I'd have to go out to West Virgina like I would have had to last year.  Even if I could just get the ones that are an easy day's drive away, that's still three races.  And the finals at Brian Head, Utah are in August.  That's a month that's normally a really good racing month for me as I've just come off of the Tour cloud where I spend a three weeks consumed with racing and bikes.</p>

<p>So now I've got a lot to think about.  To race at the national level, or not to?</p>
