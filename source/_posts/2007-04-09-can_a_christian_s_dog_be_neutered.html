title: Can a Christian's dog be neutered?
---
<p>I just finished watching <a href="http://www.jesuscampthemovie.com/">Jesus Camp</a> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486358/">IMDB</a>).  If you don't believe that the Evangelical movement is the most dangerous movement to plague American - nay, the world - you need to watch this movie.</p>

<p>The preparation for "God's Army"; the amount of "fight for America" talk; the targeting of children as a means of saving America, returning it to it's true status as a nation of God, as a Christian nation... it is terrifying.</p>

<p>This documents the Evangelical's answer to the madrasah - it's every bit as scary.</p>

<p>To my non-American readers, please know that this is a fringe group.  This in no way represents the majority of Americans.  Most of us - at least I still hold out hope - still have a grip on reality.</p>
