title: Saeco's Simoni leaves his competition at home?
---
<p>Simoni just left the starting line, but one of the Saeco team members won't be leaving at all today.  Cunego, the Simoni's younger teammate, won't be starting today.  Could it be that after Simoni was showed up by him in May that he wanted to insure at least one additional place for himself in the Tour de France by leaving Cunego at home?</p>
