title: I'm a wuss...

<p>Last night while I was driving over to a hang out with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mahoover">Megan</a> and <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh</a> listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2">All Things Considered</a>.  This past week they've had a multi-part series on the Brook Army Medical Center, the military's one burn center.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5573767">Last night's story</a> was on Sgt. Joe Fowler.  I'm sort of the emotional type anyhow (thanks, Mom), but this one really got to me.  He's a mountain biker.  My goals for the year on my bike include winning the national marathon series title, the stars and stripes (can't check that one off this year), and winning the NM series.  His goals for the year?  Having enough grip in his hands that he can ride a bike again by the end of the year.  </p>

<p>Makes my goals seem kind of silly...  </p>
