title: Happy Mother's Day

<p>
Happy Mother's Day to all you moms out there.  Yesterday, I gave probably the best mother's day gift of all time!  What is it you ask?  Flowers?  A dozen roses?  A trip to a day spa (I actually thought about that!)?  A trip to Hawaii?  No!  None of those come nearly as close to what I got her.</p>

A <strong>Gary Fisher Tiburon</strong> bike! :)  I've been hassling my mom to ride a bike more often but she kept saying she didn't have a bike (a valid argument I guess).  She's the type who would never spend the money to buy a Wal-Mart bike, much less a good one, so I decided to do it for her.  She even took it for a spin the first night!</p>

This just proves that a good bike is always the best gift to give :)</p>
