title: "Freakonomics, Chapter 4: Where have all the criminals gone?"
---
<p>This chapter is bound to drawn some interest.  Levitt and Dubner explore whether abortion has anything to do with the drop in crime a generation after it was legalized.</p>

<ul><li>"Of all of the Communist leaders deposed in the years bracketing the collapse of the Soviet Union, only Nicolae Ceausescu met a violent death.  It should not be overlooked that his demise was precipitated in large measure by the youth of Romania - a great number of whom, were it not for his abortion ban, would never have been born at all." - page 119</li>
<li>Discussing how some experts miss the forest for the trees: "The mayor of a city sees that his citizens celebrate wildly when their team wins the World Series.... So the following year, the mayor decrees that his citizens start celebrating the World Series <em>before the first pitch is thrown</em> - an act that, in his confused mind, will ensure victory." - page 123</li>
<li>Isaac Ehrlich wrote a paper in 1975 which is often used as the "proof" that the death penalty works.  According to his paper, 1 execution saves 7 lives. - page 125</li>
<li>In talking about the idea that "innovative policing strategies" lead to a decrease in crime: "This theory rapidly became an article of faith because it appealed to the factors that, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith">John Kenneth Galbraith</a>, most contribute to the formation of conventional wisdom: the ease with which an idea may be understood and the degree to which it affects our personal well-being."</li>
<li>In talking about the effect of gun buyback programs and their effect on homicide: "Given the number of handguns in the United States and the number of homicides each year, the likelihood that a particular gun was used to kill someone that year in 1 in 10,000.  The typical gun buyback program yields fewer than 1,000 guns - which translates into an expectation of less than one-tenth of one homicide per buyback." - page 133</li>
<li>"The typical crack murder involved one crack dealer shooting another (or two of them, or three) and not, contrary to <em>conventional wisdom</em>, some bug-eyed crackhead shooting a shopkeeper over a few dollars" - page 134, emphesis mine</li>
<li>"Another minor contributor to the falling homicide rate [among those likely to be crack dealers] is the fact that some crack dealers took to shooting their enemies in the buttocks rather than murdering them; this method ofviolent insult was considered more degrading - and was obviously less severely punished - than murder." - page 135</li>
<li>"In the early days of the [United States], it was permissible to have an abortion prior to "quickening" - that is, when the first movements of the fetus could be felt..." - page 137 - that's an interesting tidbit you don't hear/read every day.</li>
<li>"Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness; unwantedness leads to high crime; legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime.  This theory is bound to provide a variety of reactions, ranging from disbelief to revulsion, and a variety of objections, ranging from the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=quotidian">quotidian</a> to the moral." - page 139</li>
<li>"But when it comes to cause and effect, there is often a trap in ... open-and-shut thinking.... We too embrace faulty causes, usually at the urging of an expert proclaiming a truth in which he has a vested interest." - page 140</li>
<li>"What the link between abortion and crime does say is this: when the government gives a woman the opportunity to make her own decision about abortion, she generally does a good job of figuring out if she is in a position to raise the baby well." - page 144</li></ul>

<p>How's that for an introduction to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/006073132X/ref=pd_wt_1?coliid=I2X651R8O5EOA">Freakonomics</a>?  This is definitely one of the more provocative books I've read in awhile.</p>
