title: When it rains, that means its monsoon season

<p>I've pissed somebody upstairs off.  And I mean in a big kind of way.</p>

<p>So yesterday evening I decided I'm going to finally get that synthetic chain lube off of my road bike and switch to some dry lube.  I've been meaning to since I moved here, but I just havne't gotten around to it.  So I get the chain cleaned up and go to get the gunk off of the chain rings when the small ring catches on the rag...  the finish is peeling off!</p>

<p>I haven't been home today to do much research into what's causing that, but it might mean a new chain ring.  No big deal, but annoying just the same.  The bike only has 1000 or so miles on it.</p>

<p>So, this morning I pull out old trusty, my bomb proof Bullit that nothing can happen to (the way I ride it anyway).  I knew one of the seals was leaking a bit, but no biggie as I just ordered the new <a href="http://www.enduroforkseals.com/id53.html">enduro seals</a>.  It won't hurt it to take it on one more ride...</p>

<p>When I got up to Flagstaff and unload the bike, the leaking fork leg was extended out an extra 3"!  No, I didn't just drive 2+ hours to unload my bike, load it back up and drive back home.  I fiddle with it a bit and determine that once the axle is in place it'll be held there so it'll be good enough for one ride.  Thankfully, it was.  </p>

<p>But still, four bike, four issues.  All in two and a half weeks!  This is crazy; I haven't had this much trouble with bikes in... well, forever.  Seriously, I'm thinking one of the bike gods has it in for me.  Ew... I know, it's the god of the 26" wheel!  He's got it out for me with all my 29'er talk.</p>

<p>I did fall in love today, bad fork and all.  The trails in Flagstaff are unbelievable.  Anything that has a trail who's nickname is Organ Donor (the official name is Cat Walk), has to be awesome.  I don't think I've ever done a 6 mile decent before.  But those trails were crying for a 29'er.</p>
