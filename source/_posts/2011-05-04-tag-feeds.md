Two weekends ago I quietly rolled out a new feature that people have been
clamoring for here at TravisSwicegood.com.  Feeds for tags.  So say you're only
interested in following my [personal][] posts, you can add that tag page to
your favorite RSS reader to subscribe to it.

Or if you're geeky, you might want to subscribe to my [armstrong][] feed but
don't like the automagical discovery.  In that case, just add `/atom/` to the
end of the URL and you've got your RSS feed.

Ok, time to fess up.  Nobody's actually asked for it, but since moving over to
the new site last year I've only had one feed.  It's been a sore spot and I've
censored myself on my blog feeling I need to keep it cohesive.  Screw that now.
