title: Kick-off of MTS07
---
<p>Made it in to Seattle yesterday with no real issues.  I had a kid in the sitting behind me that liked seeing how hard she could kick my seat, not fun.  We got loaded up on the plane, then one of the ground crew came on and said they didn't have half of our bags.  Thankfully, my bag made it, but apparently Southwest had major bag issues yesterday.</p>

<p>I'll apologize up front to my non-techie readers, but the next few days' posts will probably be 90% tech.  If you see MTS07 in the title and don't care about what Microsoft is up to, you can safely ignore it.</p>
