title: I'm in love
---
<p>100%, head over heels, can't go on living without the other kind of love.  You got it right!  Me - the one who will always maintain his independence and never become dependant upon another.  I've got a picture, but...</p>

<p>Had ya going there for a minute, didn't I?  Seriously though, this Segway contraption pictured on the right is unbelievably cool.  I was down at the <a href="http://www.segway.com/cgi-bin/dealers.cgi?zip=64151">Segway Store</a> - excuse me, the Segway <em>Experience</em> this afternoon and took one of this badboys for a spin.  It actually reminds me of flying.  The first time (well, the only time) I flew a plane it took me about 30 seconds to actually fly level.  It took about the same amount of time to actually stand still on a Segway.</p>

<p>For those of you who don't follow technology as if it will produce the next savior, a Segway is a self-balancing "human transporter" - their actual name is <em>Segway HT</em>.  Basically it works like this, there are two sensors in the platform you stand on.  The sensors detect where you are leaning and translate that into digital information that is interpetted and moves you around.  Lean forward, you move forward.  Lean backward, you move backward.  What happened when I first hopped on was an ever-so-slight rocking back and forth as I got my "Segway legs".  Once you get the hang of it, you can rocket around on 'em.</p>

<p>Anyhow, they are unbelievably cool.  If you want to make a programmer's day, feel free to fullfil my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/104-1170782-9247113?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;id=VYOSWBO3MIYH">Amazon Wish List's #1</a> request.</p>

<p>You know on second thought, I should have had my picture take on it...  They have a digital camera there at the store and will email you a photo.  Oh well, I'll have pictures enough of me zooming around on mine soon enough!</p>

<p>For the record before any rumors get started and I have to defend myself.  <strong>Yes,</strong> I did have a perma-grin as I started wheeling around on this and no, I'm not one bit ashamed... ;) </p>
