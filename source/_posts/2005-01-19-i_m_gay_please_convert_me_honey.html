<p>No.  I'm not coming out or anything like that, but this is brings up an interesting ethical question.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4188495.stm">group of researchers</a> have determined that the non-jock, male Australian cuttlefish are posing as female cuttlefish to get past the bigger counterparts and "[meet] females under rocks".  What they're doing under those rocks we'll leave to your imagination - let's just say there were lots more smaller cuttlefish swimming around now because it worked half the time!  </p>

<p>There were 41 delicate situations where the cuttlefish in drag were mistaken for real live females in dire need of a good mating.  There were bruised egos and embarrassed looks all around, and the bigger, more manly cuttlefish did have to rough the poor guy to send a message that he wasn't going to be played like that, but still... it worked half the time!</p>

<p>Ok... so now to the ethical question: is this article saying that pretending to be gay to get in a girls pants is not really playing her, but that it's only biology overruling common decency?  Or am I reading way too much into it? :)</p>
