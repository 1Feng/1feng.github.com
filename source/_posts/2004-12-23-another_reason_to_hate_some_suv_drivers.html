title: Another reason to hate some SUV drivers
---
<p>Ok... as if sucking down an inordinate amount of gas, taking up too much on the road, and just generally be in the way wasn't reason enough to hate some <em>SUV drivers</em> - now they're literally <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/12/07/boys.hit.ap/index.html">running people over</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A woman ran over two teenage brothers after they <em>accidentally</em> hit her sport utility vehicle with a golf ball they were bouncing in a parking lot, officials said. One of the boys suffered life-threatening injuries. - <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/12/07/boys.hit.ap/index.html">CNN Story</a>, Emphasis mine.</p></blockquote>

<p>And you thought <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/08/22/i_m_a_militant_suv_hater">I was kidding</a> when talking about nearly being run over.  </p>

<p>We should really require some sort of counseling for these drivers before we just let these people go spend $40k on a ride like this.  You know, similar to the type of counseling they receive before getting a penis/breast enlargement. ;)</p>
