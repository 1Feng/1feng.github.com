title: A great audio program
---
<p>Occasionally, I'll hear something on the radio that just won't let me leave my car.  NPR has a phrase for these - <a href="http://shop.npr.org/catalog/Product.jhtml?CATID=&amp;PRODID=prod360002">driveway moments</a>.  Tonight was one such case.</p>

<p>I was coming back from a meeting of the Lakeside Cycling Club and was tuned to <a href="http://www.kcur.org">KCUR</a> listening to <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">This American Life</a>.  Tonight's program, Episode 282, was about a man who was wrongly convicted of murder and served more than 20 years in prison.  This is a story about what can happen when the system goes wrong, but more importantly it is the story of a friend who wouldn't give up.  <em>Carl King</em> spent 21 years working for his friend.  Talking to anyone who would listen.  Hoping against what would seem like insurmountable odds that he could prove what he knew - his friend was innocent.</p>

<p>This is well worth the hour long listen.  You can <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/ra/282.ram">listen to it here</a> in RealAudio format, or you can <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/webwares/basket.jtmpl?act=addbycode&amp;code=282">purchase a CD of the program</a> for $13.  If you enjoy radio, consider purchasing this as an investment in the excellent shows that <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">This American Life</a> puts on.  I don't want to ruin the end of it, but you've got to listen to the point that the lawyer makes at the end.  Very, <strong>very</strong> powerful.</p>
