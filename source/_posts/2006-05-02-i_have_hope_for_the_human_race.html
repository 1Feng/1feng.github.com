<p>No, they weren't on bicycles, but tonight for the first time I saw other people walking to the grocery store from the complex I live in.  I like to think we've just been missing each other all these months, but the cynical side of me thinks it might be the $3.05+ a gallon for gas that's making people think twice about cranking up to drive across the street.  Three cheers for record oil profits. ;D</p>

<p>At any rate, I go from having seen no one walking to the store from my complex to four people in one night!  An interesting side note, we were all under 30.</p>
