title: World Premiere of Whiskey Off-Road 2006 video
---
<p>Ok - so it's not the premiere or anything, but the video's available on <a href="http://www.vladfoto.com/main.php">Vlad's site</a>.  I've also posted a copy of it on my photo site <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/videos/whiskey_06.mov.html">here</a> (a little easier to get to).</p>

<p>All of the helmet cam footage is stuff I shot during the race.  Vlad did an awesome job putting it all together to make the video.  When you see someone in the race that's wearing day glow yellow, that's me :)</p>

<p>So now to figure out how to get my name on IMDB for the work on this ;)</p>
