And this just a day after I noticed Microsoft's first Europe-focused add.  They had one of their "we're here to help you adds" about a small hat maker.  If you watched carefully, when the lady hopped on a sub, she passes in front of an English Underground sign.  Subtle way to say "see EU, we still love you...".</p>
