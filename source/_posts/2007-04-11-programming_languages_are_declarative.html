title: Programming languages are declarative
---
<p>Why don't people understand this?  I've spent a bit of time today on the <a href="http://www.azphp.org/">AzPHP</a> mailing list offering up reasons as to why inline API documentation is a bad thing (private list, so no link).</p>

<p>Think about it - a programming language is a way to declare what you want the computer to do.  It's that simple.  With a properly written program, all the API docs are doing is hiding the code that tells me exactly what is going on instead of what a programmer once knew - thought in a lot of cases - was going on.  And if your code is so complex, or so convoluted that you <em>have</em> to document it in plain-English just to start to understand it, it's time to start refactoring.</p>

<p>This isn't to say I'm not a fan of documentation.  I just differ from mainstream PHP in what form I <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/pocket_guide/3.0/en/other-uses-for-tests.html#other-uses-for-tests.agile-documentation">look for</a>.  Give me a unit test any day over a three paragraph docblock.   The test provides an assumption, the code to prove it, and an example of how I should actually use your code in - get this - real code.  It's a win-win-win.</p>

<p>Ok - I'll hop off of my soap box now.  Less than 60 hours to go until the pain and torture of this year's <a href="http://www.dawntilduskrace.com/">Dawn 'til Dusk</a>.  I'm waking up at night in a cold <strike>sweet</strike> sweat thinking about the two climbs this year.</p>
