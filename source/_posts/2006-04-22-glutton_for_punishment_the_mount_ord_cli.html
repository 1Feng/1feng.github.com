title: "Glutton for punishment: The Mount Ord Climb"
---
<p>What can I say?  I love climbing.  Ok, well maybe love is a strong word, but I thoroughly enjoy climbing.  Just not racing and climbing.  I haven't worked those two into a good relationship yet, but I'm getting there.</p>

<p>So today me and a few other mountain bikers (read: crazy people) from Fountain Hills took off for <a href="http://trails.mtbr.com/cat/united-states-trails/trails-arizona/trail/PRD_164548_4513crx.aspx">Mount Ord</a>.  It was 5.75 miles to the top and took over an hour.  That's right, an hour of going straight up.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Doh... Forgot to mention that I have a Google Earth rendering of the climb <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/ride-maps/Mount+Ord+Climb.jpg.html?g2_imageViewsIndex=0">here</a>.</p>
