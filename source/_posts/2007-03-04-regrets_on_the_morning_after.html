title: Regrets on the morning after
---
<p>Ouch, ouch, ouch.  Oh, and did I say ouch?  Yesterday, I went to the Yoga Basics class offered at <a href="http://www.flagstaffathleticclub.com/">FAC</a>.  I really enjoyed the class because a lot of the poses had "you can stop here, or..." and there were more advanced continuations of the poses for those who weren't doing yoga for the first time.  I'm a pretty flexible guy, so I followed along taking it as far as I could.  I'm happy to report that I was able to do all of the poses (even the <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/785_1.cfm">eagle pose</a>), though some were definitely more graceful than others.</p>

<p>But today...  <strong>Ouch!</strong>  As I write this, I've got a heating pad on my back to try to get blood back into the muscle so it can do its thing.  I forgot how bad the morning after of yoga could be.</p>
