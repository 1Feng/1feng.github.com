title: Cheney Defends Use Of Four-Letter Word (washingtonpost.com)

<p>Aren't there more important things to be doing in Washington?  Last time I checked, we still had a "war" on our hands in Iraq, Bin Laden was still on the loose, and we house some of the worst educated children of a developed nation in the world.  Seems like more energy should be spent focusing on how to fix those issues instead of determining whether decorum exists in the Senate and making calls to "rise above partisan retaliation".  How about finding that "common ground" and quit talking about it.  There's work to be done by both sides.  The fact that so much time is wasted on whether the VP is sorry for his "forceful" words just shows how little politicians actually want to accomplish.</p>
