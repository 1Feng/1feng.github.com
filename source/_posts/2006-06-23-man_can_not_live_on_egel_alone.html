title: Man can not live on eGel alone
---
<p>I got up this morning and couldn't decide what I wanted to eat.  After an hour of trying to decide, I opted for the <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">eGel</a> and a ride route.  Downed the gel and was determined to give my legs a good beating on the hills.  </p>

<p>Started out with my Kingstree to Palamino climb.  About 4 miles, normally takes around 16 minutes (now - I started the year at over 17 minutes).  There's a ~15% grade toward the bottom of the climb that serves as a wake up.  The last time I did that, my heart rate got up to 185'ish, today when I hit it I was pushing 195!  I got into a rhythm and was feeling about like I normally do when I'm <abbr title="time trial">TT</abbr>'ing it, and hit both of the time checks (road crossings) in excellent time.  Then I got to the final 3/4 of a mile that has a few sections that kick up around 8%... and exploded.</p>

<p>Remember that gel I had?  I didn't drink enough water with it so I had a good ol' fashion gel bomb in my stomach.  I wanted to vomit.  It would have felt better.   My pace dropped big time, though I knew I was on pace for a <abbr title="personal record">PR</abbr> based on my second time check, I was done.  I pulled the pace down a bit on the steeper stuff and picked up what I could as it leveled out.  It hurt.  Then I made it to the turn around, hit the lap button.  15:44, 3 seconds off of my PR.</p>

<p>So my legs are playing it coy.  They're all "leave us alone, we're dead, we've got no umph", then they pull that out.  Nutrition and traffic kept me from a personal record.  If I had eaten something more easily digestable for breakfast and didn't have to wait nearly 10 seconds for traffic to clear at the first road crossing, I would have shattered my old PR.  Oh, and I just put a new training tire on the rear wheel that's about a quarter pound heavier than the tires I had been using.</p>

<p>Yup - I'm as ready for these upcoming races as I've been all year. </p>
