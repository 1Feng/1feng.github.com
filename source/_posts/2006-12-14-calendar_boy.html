title: Calendar boy
---
<p>Check this <a href="http://www.skaterock.com/photos/RideAZ_2007/index.htm">calendar</a> layout out.  RideAZ - a group of mountain bikers out of Phoenix puts together a calendar each year.  I think I've been on maybe 3 or 4 rides this year with RideAZ and only one of them was during the day and I end up with the cover.  Pretty spiffy...</p>

<p>I  wonder if I should add <em>calendar boy</em> to my <a href="http://racing.travisswicegood.com/">race resume</a>? :-)</p>
