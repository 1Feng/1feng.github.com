title: Rough couple of days
---
<p>So I'm back from California.  Fun place, but my trips there are always too short and too crammed full of todos to actually get more than a cursory glance of the area to see if I really don't like it or if its all just a preconceived notion.  The trip back was uneventful, though I was surprised to learn that the San Jose airport doesn't open until 4:30 AM and doesn't have a single flight out before 6 AM.  You would think that with it serving as the airport to the technology hub of the US it would have flights out at all times of the day.</p>

<p>Anyhow... Sunday <a href="http://blog.accordingtomegan.com/">Meg</a> started having some lower abdominal cramps that she was rating as an 8.5 of 10, time for the ER.  They decided to put her on an IV to get some fluids back in her, and just a few minutes in to trying to get the IV in I subconsciously decided checking in for myself would be good - or something like that.  I passed out and conked my head pretty good on a door hinge.  Xrays were good and neither my cognitive or motor skills seemed impaired after I came back to full consciousness.  An hour later they discharged both of us; turns out a nasty stomach virus has been floating around Lawrence this week and Meg was one of many to turn to the ER with stomach issues.</p>

<p>Yesterday I woke up with a stiff neck, but nothing too bad.  Then last night happened.  I woke up a few times in the night and became tremendously aware that the room was spinning.  It was seriously like I had just finished off half a bottle of something.  I don't know if I became dizzy after I woke myself up, or if I woke myself up because I became dizzy, but other way it was interesting.  This morning when I woke up I wasn't as dizzy as I had been the night before, but moving quickly did make the room swoon.  So another trip to the doctor.  Like I figured, the doctor thinks I have post concussion syndrome, or <abbr title="post concussion syndrome">PCS</abbr> and there's not much to do about it other than let it run its course.  I wanted to double check though.  Since my line of work is all mental, any damage to my brain could be a pretty big deal if I don't catch it early. :-)</p>

<p>Anyhow, I should be ok.  I was more balanced and had better eyesight than the doctor.  Hopefully the medicine will keep the room from spinning when I stand up without rendering my brain useless in the process.</p>
