title: I support Vote Twice for Swice!
---
<p>With all of the attention my Nader post received this last week, I decided a wiki was in order.  And as any self-respecting web developer who is about to setup a wiki would do, I have also announced <a href="http://www.votetwiceforswice.com/">my bid</a> for the Presidency of the United States of America!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.votetwiceforswice.com">VoteTwiceForSwice.com</a> is the new headquarters for the write-in campaign.  Nearly the entire site is available to edit via its wiki interface.  I want to have a platform that is truly made of the people, so please head over and contribute.  <a href="http://www.votetwiceforswice.com/index.php/Get_Involved">We need volunteers</a>.  Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.votetwiceforswice.com/index.php/Get_Involved">Get Involved!</a> page.</p>
