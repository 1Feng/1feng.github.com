title: I found Pleasantville!
---
<p>In a recent comment someone who would probably proudly declare themself part of the religious right made <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5#c75">this remark</a>:</p>

<fieldset><legend><a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5#c75">A recent comment on my site</a></legend>I'm packing up and going back to Pleasantville.....(a dear friend grew up in the North-East Pleasantville, I grew up in the Mid-West Pleasantville, and my step-mother-in-law grew up in the South-West Pleasantville)......it existed as surely as life today does.... I'm gonna find my way back.</fieldset>

<p>I've been racking my brain trying to figure out where Pleasantville was, but I think I figured it out.  Pleasantville doesn't really exist - it's a code word for <a href="http://www.christianexodus.com/">South Carolina</a>.  You see, a group of "Christian constitutionalists" is planning to set up shop in South Carolina with the intent of either receiving a "redress of grievances" or "call[ing] for a convention of the people and seek independence by 2016."  Looks like the Taliban would has some soul mates in the US.  Well, except <em>these</em> religious fanatics have it right, the Taliban were just devil spawn.</p>

<p>When you read their site, it would be easy to believe that it's just someone spoofing a site for the religious right to show how idiotic some of their "missions" are.  But, I'm afraid such is not the case.  They really are planning to attempt to take over South Carolina as their first place to a establish a Godly kingdom in the United States and return it to its Christian values.  Sorry, but I missed the part in the Bible where it talks about taking over the government <a href="http://www.christianexodus.com/index.php?module=PostWrap&amp;page=plan">10% at a time</a>.  At the risk of <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/07/24/title_5#comments">starting another holy war</a>, I did catch this verse:</p>

<fieldset><legend><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=MATT%2B22&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on&amp;language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;x=13&amp;y=11">Matthew 22:21-22</a></legend>Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.  When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</fieldset>

<p>Of course, I guess to these folks since God owns everything, it's only right they should "render" back to him this government he's so kindly lent us for the last 218 years.</p>

<p>So the next time someone tells you their headed back to Pleasantville, ask them if they really mean South Carolina.  Oh, and ask them if there are still limits on the colors of paint you can use. ;)</p>
