Wow!  So my routine changing the seals and oil on my fork is turning into something I feel is going to be a whole lot bigger.</p>

<p>I'm no expert on downhill forks, but I don't think a 1/8" bulge around at 1" burst in a tube is a good thing.  Geez... trouble really does come with company.  In case you can't tell, that's a quarter in the picture...</p>
