title: Everybody do the rain dance
---
<p>There's a <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/US/AZ/Fountain_Hills.html">40% chance</a> of rain today.  It's not looking good as the sun's already up and there aren't that many clouds.  The likelihood is supposed to increase as the day does, so everybody do a <a href="http://www.inquiry.net/outdoor/native/dance/fundamental_steps.htm">rain dance</a> today.</p>
