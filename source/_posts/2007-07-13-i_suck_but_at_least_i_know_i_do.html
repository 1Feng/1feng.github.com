title: I suck, but at least I know I do...

<p>I know, I know.  I'm still alive for those of you (what, one, two maybe?) that use this blog to make sure I haven't fallen off of a mountain, been run over by a semi, or unwittingly referred to as an "also among the dead" of some hippie's terrorist attack on <a href="http://www.macyscoffee.net/">Macy's</a>.  That said, I've decided I should summer in Phoenix to avoid tourist season up here.  It's becoming a major pain.  Restaurants are packed on the weekends; and not just the Applebee's, I'm talking the local joints that you should have to show a membership ID card to get into.</p>

<p>/end rant</p>

<p>I haven't ridden anything but a single speed rigid now for going on six weeks.  It's starting to grow on me.  I've only done one major climb, went up Eldon Lookout Road about 10:30 in the morning.  I haven't walked that much on a ride in a <em>long</em> time.  I need to start making it back over to the mountain some more so I can get my climbing mojo back, but there's just so much fun stuff over here that's so much closer...  Decisions, decisions...</p>

<p>The Tour's been captivating my mornings recently.  Seen some good races, but the slow-motion sprint this morning was kind of funny.  I guess no one wanted to blow a gasket the day before the mountains start.</p>

<p>The monsoon season's started a bit early this year.  We've had rain of some sort or another every day for a week.  It couldn't have come any sooner.  The <abbr title="National Forest Service">NFS</abbr> had just started floating info that they were going to close the forest the week before the rain started.  They held off, and it looks like we'll make it through this year without a closure short of there being a major fire somewhere around Flagstaff.</p>

<p>Anyhow, that's about it from here.  Send some good vibes over <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/default.aspx">Dave's</a> way.  It looks like a couple of months off of the bike due to a busted heel from last week's race.  It's a rough break, but he seems to be taking it in stride.</p>
