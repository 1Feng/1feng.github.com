title: MTS07 - Service Oriented Architecture
---
<p>Best quote: "The people who have closed systems have their little kingdoms."</p>

<p>The basics of service-oriented-architecture focus on creating services that are consumed.  Instead of a mapping web site, a service that offers access to mapping data.  Basic web services stuff applied to business services.</p>

<p>Something to read on is <abbr title="Service Markup Language">SML</abbr>.</p>

<p>Interesting presentation, just not a lot of notes.</p>
