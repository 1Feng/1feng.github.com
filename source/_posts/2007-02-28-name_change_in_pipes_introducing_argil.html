title: Name change in Pipes - introducing Argil
---
<p>Wow, where has the last week gone?  I've been meaning to announce this, but keep getting caught up in other tasks.  A few weeks ago when Yahoo announced their new Pipes framework, I decided that I was going to rename the code.  I didn't want to spend all of my time as "Pipes (Not the Yahoo! kind)" and I was worried there'd be confusion in what it was all about.</p>

<p>So, I've got a shiny new name.  Introducing <a href="http://argil.org">Argil</a>.  It's the same code, but with a new name and site.  I've also setup an <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/argil">Argil SourceForge</a> project.</p>

<p>A few updates.  First, I've ported all of <a href="http://mootools.net">Mootools</a> into a namespaced version.  Going forward, this will be the JS toolkit that Argil uses to insure maximum compatibility with all other JS frameworks and - in my opinion the most important part - <a href="http://openqa.org/selenium/">Selenium</a>.</p>
