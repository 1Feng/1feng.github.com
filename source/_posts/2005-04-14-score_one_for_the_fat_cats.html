title: Score one for the fat cats
---
<p>You know, that's a phrase that's not used often enough... <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/Dr-Fun/df200304/df20030404.jpg">fat cats</a> that is.  I guess it's because all of the news - well, almost all of the news - we get is paid for by <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/Dr-Fun/df200304/df20030404.jpg">fat cats</a>.  Shouldn't surprise me, but I guess I'm an eternal optimist...</p>

<p>Anyway, our Congress passed a bill that limits the relief available to those down on their luck.  Bankruptcy has been a way to get a clean slate and start over when the worst - a job loss, huge medical emergency, etc. - happens.  This was done to prevent "abuse" of the system, but the Senate rejected amendments that would have really limited the abuse of those who stand to gain the most - the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/Dr-Fun/df200304/df20030404.jpg">fat cats</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://schumer.senate.gov/">Senator Schumer</a> proposed an amendment - # 42 - that would have limited the amount of money allowed in an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:asset%20protection%20trust">asset protection trust</a>.  These are used by CEOs and the like to protect everything they own.  You know the new laws that hold CEOs accountable if they cook the books?  Now, every soon-to-be CEO sets up an asset protection trust to manage everything he owns so when he fudges on the books and gets sued he owns nothing - his trust owns it all.  You can sue 'til the <a href="http://www.cowtowncycling.com/">cows</a> come home, but he won't have anything to pay you with.</p>

<p>Personally, I find it revolting that this hasn't lead the news.  If they were truly out to reform the bankruptcy laws, they would be targeting the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/Dave/Dr-Fun/df200304/df20030404.jpg">fat cats</a>.  Instead, they're pandering to them... and the credit card companies that greased this bill through Congress.  Where's the outrage?  Just here I suppose...</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's note</legend>Everybody's a critic...  Dave emailed this morning wanting to cancel his subscription, so I decided I should post something.  I've been mulling this post over for the last few days, and since they passed the legislation today, I thought it appropriate to post.  Hope this makes you change your mind and you'll get that renewal check in the mail, Dave.</fieldset>
