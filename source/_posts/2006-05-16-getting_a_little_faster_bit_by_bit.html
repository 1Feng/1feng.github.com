title: Getting a little faster, bit by bit
---
<p>Went out and rode the Nova Marathon loop this morning and turned in a personal best by a minute.  Went from 1:04.22 to 1:03.25.  This morning's time was with a heavier hydration back and 3 liters of water instead of 1, plus a mean headwind on some of the faster sections.  I guess that means I am getting a bit faster (finally).  My goal is to have that under 1 hour by nationals and under 55 minutes by the end of the year.  Prior to the Nova race, my previous best was 1:09 and change, so I've already shaved 5 minutes off of my time this year.</p>

<p>I've got to work on my top end speed though.  I start daydreaming and let it slip a bit.  There were a couple of times out there today that I was thinking, "wait, I can go faster" and kicked it up a notch.  Focus, that's what I need to work on.  I've got to stay focused to keep that speed up.</p>

<p>On another note, something I didn't mention in my previous Whiskey posts, but there was what seemed like an inordinate number of <em>hot</em> mountain biker chicks racing Saturday.  All of the guys I talked to were in agreement.  And some strong racers too.  The pro from Colorado who won the Women's Open put in a time that would have been 5th in the men!  And the winner of the Women's <abbr title="Single Speed">SS</abbr> passed me on the climb from hell valley at one point until that shamed me into picking up the pace a bit.</p>
