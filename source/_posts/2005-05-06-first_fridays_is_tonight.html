title: First Fridays is tonight!
---
<p>Don't forget, tonight's the May edition of First Fridays.  Sarah from <a href="http://www.acmebicyclecompany.com/">Acme Bicycle Company</a> was telling me that there's a ton of openings over in her neck of the woods.  Be sure to head out <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Kansas+City,+MO&amp;ll=39.091217,-94.578692&amp;spn=0.018860,0.034211&amp;hl=en">18th Street</a> past Oak and check out the shows.</p>

<p>Also, if you're looking for some good, cheap pizza afterwards, check out Grinders (sorry, no site).  They'll be open until 2 and the kitchens working the whole night!</p>

<p>Keep your eyes peeled for me.  I'll be roaming around tonight.  Since you know what I look like, grab me and say hi!</p>
