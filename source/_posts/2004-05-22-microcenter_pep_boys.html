title: MicroCenter = Pep Boys
---
<p>
My Dad's <a href="http://www.toyotaliftmidamerica.com/">company</a> had asked me to price laptops for their new sales person.  Last November, I helped them pick out a Dell laptop for my Dad and apparently they liked what I did.  Instead of jumping on the first good price I saw and recommending it, I decided to make the voyage down into <a href="http://www.opkansas.org/">Overland Park</a> to visit <a href="http://www.microcenter.com/">Microcenter</a> to check prices.  Sure, I could do that online, but I wanted something to do. :)</p>

<p>
While wondering around the vast supplies of computerdom that they carry, it finally dawned on me.  Microcenter is this generation's <a href="http://www.pepboys.com/">Pep Boys</a>.  Pep Boys offers to previous generations what Microcenter offers to mine - the supplies to further tinker with the technology of your generation.  Granted, this epiphany didn't come all on my own.  It was helped by reading the <a href="http://blogspace.com/freeculture/Mere_Copyists">Mere Copyists</a> chapter of Lessig's Free Culture.</p>

<p>
Anywho... That's my epiphany for now. :)</p>
