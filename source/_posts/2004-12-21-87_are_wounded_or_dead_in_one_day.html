<p><em>Author's warning: I'm feeling pretty damn feisty today...</em></p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/12/20041220-3.html">No one can predict every turn in the months ahead, and I certainly don't expect the process to be trouble-free.</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Who'd a thunk it - trouble in Iraq?  But things were going so swell...</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/12/20041220-3.html">Yet, I am confident of the result, I'm confident the terrorists will fail, the elections will go forward, and Iraq will be a democracy that reflects the values and traditions of its people.</a></p></blockquote>

<p>You mean like the democracy in Iran?  Oh wait, that's right... we didn't like <strong>that</strong> democracy so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ajax">we overthrew it</a>.  Well, at least <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/11/30/iran_now_you_see_it_now_you_don_t_wait_t">that hasn't come back to haunt us</a> - oh wait!  It has?  Well shit, now I'm just confused... I thought Americans and our God - err, I mean President - always knew what was right.</p>
