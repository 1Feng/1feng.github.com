title: Quick note of congratulations
---
<p>My mountain bike and I have an appointment with some dirt, so I'll keep this short.  Just wanted to congratulate two of my co-workers and friends <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh</a> and <a href="http://www.leftof.net/">Megan</a> as they tie the knot after nine years of trying to figure out if they are right for each other.  :)</p>

<p>So have you ever had "balance issues" after a glass of wine and trying to shave your legs in the shower?  Yeah, me neither...</p>
