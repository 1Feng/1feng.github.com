title: New news site for Kansas City?s governed
---
<p><em>Author's Note: This just appeared on <a href="http://www.kcbloggers.com/index.php?p=247">KCBloggers</a>.  Thought I'd include it here, too.</em></p>

<p>Kansas City residents have a new resource for politics, hearings, and whatnot from around the metro at <a href="http://kccouncilwatch.blogspot.com/">KC Council Watch</a>.  To quote Joe's site, he started it because:</p>

<blockquote><p> I'm just a concerned citizen who wants to know more about what's going on with local politics.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's a great site, lots of quick info that makes it easy to digest what's going on in the governments around the metro.  Two things I wish he would do to it though:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Add an RSS/Atom feed</strong> - I'm lazy... I don't like going to sites to see what's going on, I want my feedreader to do it for me :)</li>
<li><strong>Re-license the site under Creative Commons</strong> - Ok, so I'm an <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>-activist, but hopefully once Joe gets involved in blogging he'll see the light and re-license under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">Creative Commons license</a> so others can quote him as I just did without fear of "infringement".</li></ul>

<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://blogkc.com/archives/2004/09/arena-architect-selection-goes-to-court/">BlogKC</a> for pointing this great site out.</em></p>
