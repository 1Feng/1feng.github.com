title: Wednesday Night Crits, Monday Edition
---
<p>Last night was the Wednesday night crits a few nights early.  I wasn't sure how I was going to feel after the marathon on Friday.  The muscle behind my left knee was as sore as if I had done leg extensions and I'm not exactly sure why.  That muscle doesn't normally bother me after riding.  It'll be something to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>Anyhow, we had a smaller field than normal and nobody wanted to really push the pace, which was fine by me.  I was third in the first two place prime, won the second prime, and ended up in 4th at the line, one place out of the money.  Another 50 feet or so and I could have got 3rd, but I just ran out of room.</p>

<p>I was kind of surprised by how well I did.  For the second ride in three days, my body felt sluggish and sore until I actually got on a bike and started going.  This weekend is the <a href="http://the-bicycle-company.com/Coyote.html">Coyote</a> in El Paso.  I can't wait to see how I feel in a shorter XC race.</p>
