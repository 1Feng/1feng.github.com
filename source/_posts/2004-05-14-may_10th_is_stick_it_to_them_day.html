title: May 10th is Stick it to Them Day
---
<p>I've gotten a few emails over the <em>Stick it to them day</em> that is supposed to take place on May 19th.  It's a great idea, but it doesn't go far enough.  If you really want to hurt the oil companies, don't drive your car at all on the 19th.  All you do by not purchasing on the 19th yet still drive is delay the money flow into the oil company's pockets. <br /></p>

<fieldset><legend>May 19th "Stick it to them day" email</legend>It has been calculated that if everyone in the United States did not purchase a drop of gasoline for one day and all at the same time, the oil companies would choke on their stockpiles.<br /><br /><br />
At the same time it would hit the entire industry with a net loss of over 4.6 billion dollars which affects the bottom lines of the oil companies.<br /><br /><br />
Therefore may 19th has been formally declared "<em>Stick it to Them  Day</em>" and the people of this nation should not buy a single drop of gasoline that<br />
day.<br /><br />
<br />
The only way this can be done is if you forward this e-mail to as many people as you can and as quickly as you can to get the word out.<br /><br />
<br />
Waiting on this administration to step in and control the prices is not going to happen. What happened to the reduction and control in prices that the arab nations promised two weeks ago?<br /><br />
<br />
Remember one thing, not only is the price of gasoline going up but at the same time airlines are forced to raise their prices, trucking companies are forced to raise their prices which effects prices on everything that is shipped. things like food, clothing, building materials, medical supplies etc. Who pays in the end? we do!<br /><br />
<br />
We can make a difference. if they don't get the  message after one day, we will do it again and again.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
So do your part and spread the word. Forward this email to everyone you  know.  Mark your calendars and make may 19th a day that the citizens of the United States say "enough is enough".</fieldset>
