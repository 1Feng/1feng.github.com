<p>I get into a rhythm, then life just gets in the way.  One of these days I'll actually get good at keeping this thing updated. :-)</p>

<p>I really can't believe this year is almost over.  It's been a whirlwind, in a great way.  Things have changed unbelievably this year, but so many things are just like they where.  Last year, I had just moved to a new city and was getting acquainted my surroundings; this year I'm doing the same.  Last year, I was excited about the upcoming race season but wasn't training nearly enough; this year, I'm excited about the upcoming race season and still not doing enough (but more than last year).  Can you believe it's just over a month until I hit the <a href="http://mbaa.net/racing/index.html">first race</a>?</p>

<p>Happy Holidays to all of you.</p>
