title: b2evolution 0.9 is out!

<p>
<a href="http://fplanque.net">Francois</a> pulled a fast one on us!  He released v0.9 a day early for us Americans! :)  Grab your copy today (or bug me to install it as the case may be Sarah...).  Looks like there's a whole host of new features.  This site, as well as <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws">Crossroads</a> will be switching over soon.</p>
