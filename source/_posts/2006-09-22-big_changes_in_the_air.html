<p>I've received a lot of really positive feedback from my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/09/16/dreaming_up_a_new_life">last post</a>.  Thanks to everybody.  Two of the things I said I wanted to be able to do were to work remote full time and live in Flagstaff.  One of those has happened and I'm working on the other.</p>

<p>This week I accepted an offer a <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>, a company that specializes in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_%28web_application_hybrid%29">mashups</a> (see <a href="http://oren.blogs.com/praxis/">Oren Michels</a>' <a href="http://oren.blogs.com/praxis/2006/06/introducing_mas.html">Introducing Mashery</a> for more about the company).  I'm really looking forward to working <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/blog/">Paul Jones</a> (of <a href="http://solarphp.com/">Solar</a> and <a href="http://phpsavant.com/">Savant</a> fame) again and <a href="http://killersoft.com/">Clay Loveless</a> (of <a href="http://feedster.com/">Feedster</a> and soon-to-be Mashery fame).  Both are great guys and excellent programmers.  This is the second job in a row Paul has been responsible for.  My time at <a href="http://www.uversainc.com/">Uversa</a> came out of a knowing <a href="http://blog.joshuaeichorn.com/">Josh</a> via Paul's Savant, and this job came directly from Paul.  I owe him a beer the next time we're in the same city.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I'll be doing web app development still, but it will be remote.  This next week I'm going to spend a few days in Flagstaff trying to find a place to rent.  I'm hoping for a house, but will settle for an apartment/condo again assuming I can get one with a garage for all of my bikes.  Got to take care of the babies.</p>

<p>But this weekend's all about old friends.  I'm heading back out to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyover_country">flyover country</a> to visit with some friends.  </p>
