title: Sometimes the road calls
---
<p>I've been having a hard time getting to sleep recently.  If I was a drunk, I'd be drinking myself into sleep, but I'm not.  I'm a reader, so I read myself into sleep.  When the words and lines cross and the same sentence seems new even though its the fifth time I've tried to read it, I put my book aside and succumb to sleep.  Restless, tortured sleep.</p>

<p>I exaggerate.  But then again, it is past midnight and my normal bout with a book didn't work.  I laid in bed for 15 minutes before finally switching the light back on and bringing up a book of sudoku.  A few puzzles later and I'm even more awake than I was when I started.  Normally the pattern and the numbers will lull me into a stupor, priming my mind for dreams where numbers overlay the world and navigating my dream world requires a pattern matching skill not unlike that necessary for <a href="http://www.conceptispuzzles.com/products/sudoku/solution_examples.htm#scanning">scanning</a> in sudoku.</p>

<p>I've been fighting it, but tonight I have no choice but to admit what's been keeping me awake.  A road has been calling me.  It's a desolate one, leading to a not-unfamiliar town in middle America.  I drove this road for the first time late one night some four or five months ago.  It was the first time I drove down this road, I wasn't sure were it would lead me.  A few hours down the road and I stopped.  Since then, it's been calling me and I've been ignoring it.</p>

<p>Every night it crosses my mind as I dive further and further into the next book, the next puzzle, the next level on a video game.  Its call started out gentle, but as I've ignored it, it has grown impatient.  As it has grown impatient, it has grown louder, until tonight I can't hardly close my eyes but I see the road markers lazy pass by as I drive down that road.  I can't hardly drift to sleep for the gentle thud as I hit the stutter bumps as the road reminds me that it is there.  Waiting, asking to be driven.  Still gently, but persistently.</p>

<p>I've no other choice but to give in.  I've got to follow this road and see where it winds up.  Where it goes, I'm not sure yet.  I know this much: it takes me to a week in a life that I've yet to live.  It takes me to some discovery.  Profound or mundane?  I've yet to realize it.  This road won't leave me alone until I explore it and see where it leads to.</p>

<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a story to write.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thud, thud, thud.</p></blockquote>
