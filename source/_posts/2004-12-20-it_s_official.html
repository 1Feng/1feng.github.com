<p>If you don't like SUVs and go to Google trying to find someone like-minded, you'll find me!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22suv%20hater%22&amp;start=9">"suv hater"</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22suv%20assholes%22&amp;start=8">"suv assholes"</a></li></ul>

<p><em>Note: I'm not really #1, just #9 and #8 respectively, but I get hits from these searches on a regular basis.</em></p>

<p>Again, it's not that <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/08/22/i_m_a_militant_suv_hater">I hate SUVs</a> in principle or their drivers, just <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2004/05/12/cycling_in_the_northland">some of them</a>.  It annoys me to no end to see someone driving solo in an <a href="http://www.fuh2.com/">H2</a> in rush hour traffic in KC.  Sure, if you live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadar_City">Sadar City</a> or some other war-torn urban area, feel free to get yourself a Hummer to help navigate your trip to work (and consider up-armoring it too).  I'm sorry, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_County%2C_Kansas">Johnson County</a> doesn't cut it for war torn.  I know those <a href="http://www.kcisstrange.com/index.php?p=110">high schools can be just brutal</a>, but I think a regular sized car with a regular sized appetite for gas will do just fine.</p>
