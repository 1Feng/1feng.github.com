<p>He's covering WPF and WPF/E.  He's running the first non-Vista laptop.  Very important for you guys to know that :-)</p>

<p>He's using MS Expression Blend to build the WPF's.  It currently works for desktop apps.  It's a visual IDE much like Flash.  Has some neat features, but then I haven't kept up with this type of "development" as I don't do it.</p>

<p>One of the cool features is being able to search through a toolbar and filter the tools that are shown so you don't have to search through everything if you don't know where it's at.  </p>

<p>This type of environment in JS would be useful for doing Canvas animation and such in FF.</p>

<p>He just demoed a cool photo book that had really good virtual photo book.  Also, the Blend environment will allow you to resize the entire environment which is very cool.  <a href="http://galbraiths.org/blog/">Ben has some cool photos</a> on his recap.</p>

<p>WPF/E brings the WPF environment onto the web.  Things like vector drawing, 3d animations, etc., are possible.  3d isn't native in WPF/E, but it is possible.  Had some tubes floating, a rubix cube, etc.  Also had the photo book online.</p>

<p>The code that makes it work online is working in IE, FF, and Safari.</p>
