title: The next eight weeks
---
<p>Are going to be a blur.  The good kind, but I have a feeling I'm going to hit the third week of July and wonder where the time went.</p>

<p>It will culminate with Nationals in Sonoma; which I'll be registering for this week.  Other than that there's the marathon in Deer Valley the first week of July, and two <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org">NMORS</a> races in June.  Couple that in with a lot of training between now and then and my usual <a href="http://www.uversainc.com/">vocation</a>, and riding is what I'm going to being focusing on.  </p>

<p>Compared to April and May, June is going to be a very light race month.  That's actually good because it's going to let me do more rides like I did this morning where it's just time in the saddle.  I didn't necessarily plan it this way back in March when I decided to give the NORBA marathons a go, but it worked out this way just the same.</p>
