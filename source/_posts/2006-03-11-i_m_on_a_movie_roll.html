title: I'm on a movie roll
---
<p>The last two new-to-me movies I've watched have been unbelievable, but also extremely depressing.  I finally watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387131/">The Constant Gardener</a>.  Wow.  The movie was excellent.  For the first 45 minutes I kept thinking "ok, so I already know this from the previews, how are they going to fill another hour or more?" then it sucks you in.  The last 1:15 just flew by.</p>

<p>When the novel a movie is based on is banned in the country it depicts, it tells you it must have hit too close to home.  One of my favorite lines of the movie was along the lines "This is all guilt" in describing aid to Africa.  Definitely add this to your must see list of movies.</p>
