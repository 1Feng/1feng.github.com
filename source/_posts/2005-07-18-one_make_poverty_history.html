title: "One: Make poverty history"

<p>Via <a href="http://www.ascottmcculloch.com/wp/">Scott McCulloch's blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>WE BELIEVE that in the best American tradition of helping others help themselves, now is the time to join with other countries in a historic pact for compassion and justice to help the poorest people of the world overcome AIDS and extreme poverty.... <em>WE COMMIT ourselves - one person, one voice, one vote at a time - to make a better, safer world for all</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sun.com/one/">commercial</a> (being hosted by <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a>) is great.  It's the first commerical Al Pacino has ever done and is up for <a href="http://politicaltechnology.com/one/blogs/one_blog/archive/2005/07/14/1656.aspx">an Emmy too</a>.</p>
