title: Tuesday's ride...

<p>I could write up a whole long post about how good the ride was, the area's I felt good in and what didn't feel right, etc., etc.  But I figured I would just leave you with this picture that sums up the ride.</p>

<p>That's right - just shorts.  No tights... Winter's not over and it's already warm enough to ride without tights or leg warmers.  I guess there are a few things to be said for global warming ;-)</p>
