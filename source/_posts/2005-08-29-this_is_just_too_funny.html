<p>Man... You do <strong>not</strong> want to get on the <a href="http://superficialplazachick.blogspot.com/">Plaza Chick's</a> bad side...   :D</p>

<p>The comments are outragous.  I read her post earlier this morning when it popped into my feed reader, and didn't think about checking back to see how the comments went until this evening when I noticed she <a href="http://superficialplazachick.blogspot.com/2005/08/roasting-aftermath.html">posted again</a>.  The funniest comments are from <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~k8tertot/">Katie's</a> @ <a href="http://superficialplazachick.blogspot.com/2005/08/roast-life-of-single-woman.html#c112534772429164990">1:35</a> through JC's @ <a href="http://superficialplazachick.blogspot.com/2005/08/roast-life-of-single-woman.html#c112534772429164990">1:51</a>.</p>

<p>Seriously... it goes from</p>

<blockquote><p><em>JC @ 1:39</em><br />
Katie..whatever....I think you are one of those fat miserable women that can only get laid on nickel draw night at the local pub</p></blockquote>

<p>To</p>

<blockquote><p><em>JC @ 1:51</em><br />
Katie...just looked at your blog...ok...well I am man enough to accept my mistakes..you are pretty...as can be seen from your pictures. Do you date older guys?</p></blockquote>

<p>So it takes 12 minutes to go from, "you're a fat miserable bitch" to "hey, wanna hang out sometime?".  Seriously, though, that "you are pretty" thing, just gets me all verklempt... r-really b-b-beautiful, man.</p>
