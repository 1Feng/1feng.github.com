title: Whiskey Results
---
<p>The <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/past/worpast/wor-06-results.htm">results</a> are posted for the Whiskey.  Turns out I picked up 28th place, not 29th.  And yes, I really was just five seconds (if that) from the guy in 27th.  I tried my damnedest to reel him in at the line and have the helmet cam footage to back me up.</p>

<p>Speaking of the helmet cam, I was wearing one for my buddy Vlad of <a href="http://vladfoto.com/main.php">VladFoto</a>.  He'll be putting together a short 2 or 3 minute video of the race using the footage he shot and some of my helmet cam footage.  As soon as he's got it posted I'll put a link up so you guys can share in my debut as a helmet cam dude. :)</p>
