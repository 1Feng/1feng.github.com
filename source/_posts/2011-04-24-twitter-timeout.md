A few weeks ago, I got a lot of responses to the following tweet:

<div style="width:498px; margin:0 auto;">
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110425-x25u1r64n4emja5dcywp11y6qw.png" alt="twitter-timeout" />
</div>

As I write this post, Twitter's ever-unreliable updates counter is showing that
I have 9,999 tweets.  It's time for a Twitter Timeout.

Why? I've found myself thinking too quickly, without depth, mostly in the form
of 140 characters. I want to get back to my place, my blog.

I'm tired of playing in other people's backyards, as it were.  A large part of
my interactions with the world are through Twitter and Facebook, two things I
don't own.  My blog, my email.  Those are mine.  Until the Internet gives way
to some bastardization of itself in the name of safety, security, or the
God-forsaken "user experience," it will always be mine to give
and not at the control of some private entity.

So, I'm shuttering my Twitter account for a little while.  I'm not sure how
long, but I won't be responding to any tweets or reading Twitter for a little
while.

My contact information is amazingly public (it's in the sidebar), so there's no
shortage of ways to get in touch with me.  Feel free to.
