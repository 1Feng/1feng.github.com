title: Why should I vote for Ralph Nader?
---
<p>I don't know that I should, but a guy who's so involved in community activism that when he tries to draw a comparison between being active as the underdog and loosing a basketball game, only to say "when you're 30 points down in the 4th quarter, do you give up and go home" should deserve a second look.  Seriously, in a commentary/news piece done on <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1972353">NPR this evening</a>, Ralph was quoted saying the above to a group of students.  Pretty funny, I think.</p>

<p>While Nader is generally too liberal for my centrist tastes, he does traits I find interesting.  He "detests" reality TV which in and of itself is almost a reason to vote for him.  The one thing I find troubling, his lack of an embrace for technology.  He still favors a manual typewriter instead of a word processor.  His reason is quite unique though...  He says it forces you to get it right the first time.</p>
