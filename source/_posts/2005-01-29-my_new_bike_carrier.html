title: My new bike carrier...

<p>Welp... I'm now officially part of the <a href="http://www.vw.com/club">club</a>...</p>

<p>In talking about hybrids, Lindsey reminded me that <a href="http://www.vw.com/">VW</a> makes a turbo diesel that gets great gas mileage.  Two trips to the dealer and I'm now the proud owner of a <a href="http://www.vw.com/passat/">Passat GLS TDI</a>.  Rumor has it that I'll be getting mid-30's around town and getting 50 mpg on the highway is not uncommon.  All of that in a zippy package that has room for bikes and all!</p>

<p>I'll be doing some investigation into running <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=biodiesel">biodiesel</a> in it to be even more eco-friendly.  Now - to suit Dave I've got to start working on a bike sticker collection... :)</p>

<p><strong>La Arana Update</strong></p>

<p>I'm wheel-less.  Everything is in and now I'm debating on whether I should build a super light set with <a href="https://www.notubes.com/rims.php?cPath=42_43">Stan's ZTR</a> rims or if I should go with the more proven <a href="http://www.mavic.com/servlet/srt/mavic/comp-prod_fiche?product.id=70&amp;lg=uk">Crossmax SL's</a>.  Then, there's always the possibility of giving <a href="http://www.spinergy.com/xyclonedisc.htm">Spinergy</a> another chance.  Decisions, decisions...</p>
