So it's been official for awhile now, but yesterday's mail made it real!  I'm officially the NMORS state champ and I have the jersey to prove it.</p>

<p>Next year the jersey's going to be tough to defend.  <a href="http://bcowan88.blogspot.com/">Bad Ass Bill's</a> going to be playing with the big boys next year even though he'll just be a senior in high school.  Smokin' Ray's son is coming up from Sport; and sporting a big Maverick bike, Jay'll continue pushing me around the course.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to it.  With the goals I have for myself at the national level, if I meet those I'll be kicking ass at the NMORS next year.</p>

<p>Sorry for the lack of posts recently.  With the move and the new job and attempting to be social from time to time I've really been swamped.</p>
