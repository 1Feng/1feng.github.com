title: Ominent Finis Iminent
---
<p>Here's a brain teaser for you.  While watching Law &amp; Order this evening - what can I say, I do enjoy the original L&amp;O series from time to time - I saw two commercials that flashed this across the screen in fiery, medieval script:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ominent Finis Iminent</p></blockquote>

<p>At first glance, it looks Latin.  <a href="http://www.dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a> only has an entry for <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=finis">finis</a>.  <a href="http://www.pseudodictionary.com/ominent">ominent</a> appears in the <a href="http://www.pseudodictionary.com/">PseudoDictionary</a> as a combination of ominous and imminent.  The last looks like an old spelling of the word eminent.  So I'm thinking the "evil end is coming" or "the end of evil is coming".</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>
