title: 2006 19 - 29 NORBA Marathon Series Champ!
---
<p>Sweet!  I just looked at the results from the Brian Head marathon, and according to my calculations I took the series title!!  :D</p>

<p>I didn't race this weekend and have been keeping my fingers crossed that the one possible scenario that could cost me the title if I didn't race didn't happen.  Looks like it didn't, so I'll take the title by 180 points!</p>

<p>Goals for the season:</p>
<ul><li>Stars and stripes jersey - nope, bad luck and a better racer took it from me</li>
<li>19 - 29 NORBA Marathon Series title - check</li>
<li>New Mexico Off-Road Series Title - <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org/results/2006-NMORS/standings.asp?Series=NMORS&amp;Year=2006&amp;Category=ExpertM19-29&amp;Gender=Men">on my way...</a></li></ul>
