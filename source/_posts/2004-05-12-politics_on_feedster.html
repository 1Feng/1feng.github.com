title: Politics on Feedster
---
<p>
Feedster has an interesting service available for politics.  They have several categories available, including <a href="http://now.feedster.com/libertarian">Libertarian</a> which doesn't have a single entry.  Is there not a viable Libertarian running this year?  Hmm... maybe I should announce my candidacy.  Oh yeah, you have to be 35.  Well, you could always do a <em>write-in Presidential</em> vote for <em>Travis Swicegood</em>.</p>
