title: Pushing the boundries of PHP
---
<p>You must be doing something right when you can send PHP into a tail spin.  That or the code you're trying to do is just evil.  Turns out __destruct() and __call() don't play well together in 5.2.4 if, and only if, you create an instance of an object without assigning it.</p>

<p>I ran into this when I coded this up:</p>

<code><pre>ensure('foobar')->equals('barfoo');</pre></code><p></p>

<p>It's for a secret project... ;-)</p>
