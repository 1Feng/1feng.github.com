<p>Love him, hate him, doesn't matter.  You've got to love this <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/cycling/news/story?id=2532396">quote from Lance</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I don't want to pass judgment until we have confirmation on the 'A' sample," Armstrong said. "I'm not going to speculate; <em>you can get Greg LeMond to go on the air and speculate.</em> I'm not going to do that. ... I'm not going south like Greg does. I believe in the sport, I'm a fan of it and I love it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.  Those two never miss a beat, do they?  Thanks <a href="http://cyclinglyfestyle.blogspot.com/2006/07/lance-kicks-back-cold-one.html">Squirrel</a> for Lance's new name. :)</p>
