title: MTS07 - Day Two

<p>I'm nursing a hang over... nothing bad, but my nose feels like it's got a vice clamp around it.  Damn that 5th glass of Pinot.</p>

<p>This morning is starting late due to a roll over on the freeway that<strike>'s</strike> <em>is on the way of the presenter who is</em> headed here so <em>to kill time</em> we're doing an open discussion of "what you want".  The general feel is that it needs more meat instead of just "look at what we did... it's great"</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Just made this intelligible.  Apparently I wasn't entirely awake when I wrote it.  Everything with <em>emphasis</em> in the above was added later.</p>
