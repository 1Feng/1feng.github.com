title: Stay safe out there...
---
<p>I wasn't going to say anything here because of my <a href="http://www.theswicegoods.com">my mom</a>, but I feel the need to.  New Mexico lost <a href="http://www.nmcycling.org/Paula.htm">Paula Higgins</a> this past week while she was riding.  While I didn't know her personally, I have raced with her.  The Landis team kit in New Mexico stuck out this past May when racing in Gallup.  The girl who hit her is from a family of cyclists, so it isn't one of those random I hate cyclists things.  Her <a href="http://obits.abqjournal.com/results?obit_id=80522">obituary</a> memorializes what sounds like a full life.  It's too bad it was cut short.</p>

<p>Remember guys (and gals), stay safe out there.</p>
