title: Lend a helping hand to a cycling god...
---
<p>Ok, well maybe <a href="http://www.evilcycling.com/images/ragbrai05/pages/02Smith-R2-047-22.htm">Zeke</a> isn't a cycling god, but he is a pretty cool guy.  This past Saturday, <a href="http://forums.earthriders.com/viewtopic.php?t=1282">Zeke was hit</a>.  They have a fund setup for him which you can Paypal money to zeke [ dot ] fund [ at ] gmail [ dot ] com.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.rideabike.org/">Marcus</a>, being the cool guy that he is is donating all the proceeds from <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/bikeguy">his shirts</a> at Cafepress to the Zeke Fund.  The pictures for <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/bikeguy.22956453">this shirt</a> was shot by yours truly at the <a href="http://www.meandtravis.com/831st-Annual-Tour-de-Cowtown-Alley-Kat">Alleykat</a> in May.  You'll notice Zeke by the pink leisure suit... :-)</p>
