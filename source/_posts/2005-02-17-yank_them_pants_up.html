title: Yank them pants up!
---
<p>On the way home this evening, I heard a pretty funny story on <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> about one guy who's had enough!  Making his way through the airport to catch a plane, he finally decided no longer would he "sag" and now he's on a mission to get other guys to reclaim their pants.  You can <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4503530">listen to the piece on NPR.org</a>.  Definitely worth the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4503530">listen</a>.</p>

<fieldset><legend>Author's note</legend>I must confess, this may not be as funny as my first impressions.  I had a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Anightcap">workcap</a> this evening, so that may have influenced this funniness...  You have been forewarned.</fieldset>
