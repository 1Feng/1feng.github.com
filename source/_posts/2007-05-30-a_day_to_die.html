title: A day to die...

<p>... is a day worth living for.</p>

<p>That's the quote that stuck with me from Pirates 3.  What a quote.  Think on it for awhile...</p>

<p>Anyhow, right about now I feel as though I should be waging war on the high sea.  I just finished the soundtrack.  Hans Zimmer is something else.</p>
