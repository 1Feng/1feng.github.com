title: I am going straight to hell!
---
<p>I've always been afraid I might, but now <a href="http://www.carm.org/kjv/Num/Num_15.htm">it looks like I'm doomed</a> (see versus 32-36).  I wonder if the fact that I didn't know that picking up sticks on Saturdays - remember, the Sabbath of the Old Testament is Saturday, not Sunday - was a sin is a defense?  "But, but... I'm not guilty by reason of ignorance your honor."</p>

<p>If not, I'm doomed because of all of the mountain bike trail work I've been doing on Saturdays...</p>
