<p>The <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/results/24results/results2007/Index.html">Old Pueblo results</a> for this year's race are posted!  Sweet, posted the day after the ride.  That's what I call organization...</p>

<p>Tinker took it again... surprise.  What did shock me was who took second.  <a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/">Dave Harris</a> was 24 minutes back...  Mr. "<a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/archive/2006/10/30/2041.aspx">My Collarbone's in Six Pieces</a>" himself.  So now we know when he says "<a href="http://teamhealthfx.com/blogs/dave_harris/archive/2006/12/04/2167.aspx">I'll still likely do it, but with different goals.</a>" that his goals have gone from lapping the field to just going for the win.</p>
