title: "Learning Languages: Starting with Spanish"
---
<p>I've decided to take back up my learning of Spanish.  I do this at least once a year... I'll be hanging out at Barnes and Noble and the language aisle will catch my fancy.  After spending a half hour or so looking through the books, I'll walk away with a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpanish-Vocabulary-Julianne-Dueber%2Fdp%2F0764119850%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1167418017%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">vocabulary book</a>, an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpanish-Idioms-Barrons-Eugene-Savaiano%2Fdp%2F0812090276%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1167417946%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">idiom book</a>, or if my bank account is really unlucky, an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMastering-Spanish-Level-Audio-CDs%2Fdp%2F0764175971&amp;tag=fromthecrossr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">audio course</a>.  Last night was that night for me.  I picked up a new small new books and determined to spend some time working on my Spanish.  I have an elementary understanding of the language.  I can pronounce words that I read relatively well - though knowing what I'm saying is a completely different issue - and can comprehend the language when spoken - though not at full speed.</p>

<p>This morning I spent thirty minutes with one of my Spanish/English dictionaries translating the introductory paragraphs from a few stories on <a href="http://news.google.com/news?ned=es_mx">Google News En Espanol</a>.  I figure it's a good way to expand my vocabulary a bit while gleaning some useful info in the process.</p>

<p>I've also decided to add a few other languages to my <em>to learn</em> list.  I've decided I want to learn Arabic (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic"><abbr title="Modern Standard Arabic">MSA</abbr></a>) and Chinese (probably Mandarin).  I don't know when I'll start on them, but they're on my list for this next year too.</p>
