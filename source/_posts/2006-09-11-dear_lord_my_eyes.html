<p>So what happens when you have a custom contest at a mountain bike race?  <a href="http://www.hornytoadhustle.org//Group1.jpg">this</a> with <a href="http://www.hornytoadhustle.org//Worst.jpg">this as the worst costume</a> and <a href="http://www.hornytoadhustle.org//winner1.jpg">this as the first one down the hill</a>.</p>

<p>Props to "Big" Dave Wilson for having the balls to do it.  Yup, those same balls that are there for all the world to see.  I've got a few emails from him the past few days.  He's back in the Army now and said the vibe sucks.  No one wants to be there except a few nut cases who're pissed because they can't get a deployment to Iraq.  What's wrong with this picture?  The guys who want to go to Iraq are pissed because they have to stay behind and corral the ones who don't want to go.</p>
