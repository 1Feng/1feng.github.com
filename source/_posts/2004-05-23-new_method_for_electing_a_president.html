title: New method for electing a President

<p><em>Quote from an email I sent out earlier today:</em><br /><br /><br />
Maybe we should have a stage race to decide this year's election.  The<br />
Tortugan could be moved a month or two couldn't it?  We've already done an<br /><br />
election and a court decision, so let's mix it up a bit! :)</p><!--more--><p><br />

Bush in mountain bike tumble<br /><br />
23/05/2004 - 09:06:45  <br /><br /><br />
President George W Bush suffered cuts and bruises when he fell while mountain <br />
biking on his ranch, White House spokesman Trent Duffy said.<br /><br />
<br />
Duffy said Bush was riding on Saturday with a military aide, members of the <br /><br />
Secret Service and his personal physician, Dr Richard Tubb.<br /><br /><br />
?He had minor abrasions and scratches on his chin, upper lip, nose, right <br />
hand and both knees,? Duffy said.<br /><br />
<br />
?Dr Tubb, who was with him, cleaned his scratches, said he was fine. The <br /><br />
Secret Service offered to drive him back to the house. He declined and finished <br />
his ride.?<br /><br />
<br />
President Bush was wearing his bike helmet and a mouth guard when the mishap <br /><br />
occurred at the ranch in Crawford, Texas. Duffy said he did not know exactly <br />
how the accident happened.<br /><br />
<br />
?It?s been raining a lot and the topsoil is loose,? the spokesman said. ?<br /><br />
You know this president. He likes to go all out. Suffice it to say he wasn?t <br />
whistling show tunes.?<br /><br />
<br />
President Bush left Crawford shortly after the bike mishap for Austin, where <br /><br />
he was attending a private party of his daughter, Jenna, who graduated from <br />
the University of Texas earlier in the day.<br /><br />
<br />
When he arrived in Austin, Bush was not wearing any bandages, although <br /><br />
scrapes were visible on his right temple and on his chin.<br /><br /><br />
As he departed from the presidential helicopter with his wife, Bush paused to <br />
give photographers a chance to take his picture, then shrugged, waved and got <br /><br />
into a waiting limousine.<br /><br /><br />
Earlier this month, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry took a spill <br />
from his bicycle while riding with Secret Service agents through Concord, <br /><br />
Massachusetts. Kerry fell when his bike hit a patch of sand. He was not injured.<br /><br /><br />
Told about Bush?s mishap, Kerry said: ?I hope he?s okay. I didn?t know the <br />
president rode a bike.?<br /><br />

candidate John Kerry took a spill from his bicycle after hitting a patch of sand <br /><br />
during a ride Sunday afternoon, but he was uninjured, campaign officials <br />
said. <br /><br />

Kerry was riding south on a two-lane road at about 1:00 p.m. in the direction <br /><br />
of Walden Pond State Reservation in Concord, a quiet, suburban town about 18 <br />
miles northwest of Boston. He was approaching a stop light at the intersection <br /><br />
with Route 2 and was slowing down when he veered left into the oncoming lane <br />
and fell, according to an Associated Press reporter who witnessed him fall. <br /><br />
Secret Service agents and local police immediately stopped traffic while Kerry <br />
and a handful of bicycling companions moved to the shoulder. "He's fine. They <br /><br />
took the bike into the bike shop, and he went home," said Kerry campaign <br />
adviser Michael Meehan. The Massachusetts senator was riding his custom Serotta <br /><br />
bicycle, and was wearing a helmet. Kerry had returned to Massachusetts, where he <br />
has a home in Boston's posh Beacon Hill section, for a break from the campaign <br /><br />
trail. Kerry, 60, rides his bicycle as often as he can get free time on the <br />
campaign trail. He even brings it along with him on the campaign plane. <br /><br />
