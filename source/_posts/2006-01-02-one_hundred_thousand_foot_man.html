title: One hundred thousand foot man
---
<p>Welp, I hit my goal - and in traditional Travis fashion, I did it in a big kind of way.  I climbed (well, pushed a bit... hey, I was on my 40 pound Bullit!) Sunrise from the east - less than 2 miles and 1,000 vertical feet.  Oh yeah, and I rode to the trailhead from my house (nearly 1,000 up and over by itself).  Total for the day: 2,346 gained in 11.83 miles.</p>

<p>So, the grand totals for the year:</p>

<table><tr><th>Saddle Time</th><th>Miles</th><th>Climbed</th><th>Descended</th></tr><tr><td>85 hours (approx)*</td><td>1,181.52 miles</td><td>102,158 feet</td><td>103,451 feet</td></tr></table>

<p>I say approximate on the saddle time because I goofed a few times when I first got my GPS and have a couple of nearly 100 rides...</p>

<p>And what did I do when I got through finishing up two days of climbing and my first (known) 100,000 foot year?  I when another semi-epic ride.  23.72 miles - on my Sugar this time - and back over to the Sonoran Mtn. Perserve.  Since I didn't see enough of it the first time, I did all of the trails I know about, including Sunrise from the West.  </p>

<p>And then descended down the west side again:</p>

<p>The descent is definitely much more enjoyable on the Bullit than on the Sugar, although pushing the Bullit up the climbs is a pain.  Anyhow, what a way to ring in the new year.  3 days of riding and 9,810 feet of climbing.  Did a mention my legs are a little heavy today?</p>
