title: Fair warning...

<p>Ignore all emails and commits to any repositories I have access to for at least a few hours...  I'm trying some hundred proof Comfort cough syrup to see if it'll help me sleep.</p>

<p>As a complete side note: isn't it funny that SouthernComfort.com will let you put in any date?  If they track the birthdays that people enter, they just had someone enter who was 126 years old ;-)  Oh, and is it the smartest thing to have motion blurs on a site for whiskey?  Seriously, I can hear it now.  "Damn!  That stuff must be good, it's making the images on my computer screen blurry."</p>

<p>Wait, they were blurry to you too, right? ;-)</p>
