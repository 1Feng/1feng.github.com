title: You know you raced too long this weekend when...
---
<p>... you take a nap and you dream about tactical changes you plan on making at next week's race.</p>

<p>What is the change, you might ask?  I'm thinking of going sans-Camelbak at next week's Gallup to see how I like racing with just a water bottle.  I'm fine with water bottles on the road, but I've never really got it down on the mountain bike.  After yesterday's back breaker, though, I've been kicking around the idea.  The only problem with the dream is I was setting it up to ride withouth the camelbak and had just got started.  I was climbing through a section pretty good and passed someone, so maybe I'll go with it... :)</p>
