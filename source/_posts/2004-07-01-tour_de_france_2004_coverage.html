title: Tour de France 2004 Coverage
---
<p>I am an avid cyclist, and love watching professional cycling.  As such, I'm going to be blogging on a near-daily basis about the Tour.  This will be the first year I will be watching it live, so it should be interesting.  So to keep up with the latest on the Tour, be sure to check out my site on a regular basis every weekday.</p>

<p>If you want more "official" reporting, be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/2004/us/index.html">Tour's website</a>.  Of course, there's no data there right now, but it looks like they have everything in place for a great site.</p>
