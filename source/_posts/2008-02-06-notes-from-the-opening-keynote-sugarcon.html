<ul><li>3 guys and a $25 internet server</li>
<li>focusing on we versus me</li>
<li>sharing ideas are critical</li>
<li>Commerializing Knowledge - SugarExchange to create devs to sell their modules</li>
<li>3 to 160 people</li>
<li>"Cloud Computing" has been listed on a half dozen slides thus far...</li></ul>

<p>Martin used Google Earth to do a "tour" of how SugarCRM grew.  It's not cooperating too well though.  IT guy to the rescue.  We have a lot of deployments in Brazil.  "It's like watching bacteria" in describing how SugarCRM is spreading in Europe.  We've got a lot of coverage in Japan and China too, but the mainland in Europe is completely covered. </p>

<ul><li>"It's great to do good, but you have to do well as well," from John Roberts describing the financial side of things.</li>
<li>"In the beginning it was a rebellion." in talking about open-source CRM.</li></ul>
