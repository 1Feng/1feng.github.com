title: I'm toast
---
<p>Ok - I just posted a comment to a post I commented on earlier today...  Sleep, must get sleep.</p>

<p>I'm toast after the crit tonight.  Legs were heavy the whole time, and the fact that they gave the 5 minute warning to start the race as I finished putting my shoes on didn't help.  I was way off the back (as in multiple laps down) at the finish of both the C and B races tonight.  And for the first time in three weeks I didn't even win the first prime.</p>

<p>Well, hopefully the <a href="http://www.juniper-solutions.com/dara/?p=59">ice bath</a> I took earlier will help tomorrow.  Two days to go until the real race season starts though.  I still can't help constantly repeating: "70 miles, 70 freaking miles.  Am I crazy?"</p>

<p>Don't answer that...</p>
