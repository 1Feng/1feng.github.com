title: I get the most random hits from Google...

<p>I get a lot of hits from Google for certain <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/01/16/my_response_to_rick_mathes">responses</a> to people, but I still get some of the oddest things from Google.  Last year it was <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/06/05/wacky_search_results">Flagstaff S&amp;M</a>, now it's showing up to people looking for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=spiffy%20book%20about%20marijuana">spiffy book about marijuana</a>.  If you find some, let me know... :)</p>
