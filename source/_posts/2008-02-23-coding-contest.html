<p>This <a href="http://c7y-bb.phparchitect.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1108">contest</a> could be fun.  It appears that <a href="http://blog.preinheimer.com/">Paul "PHP" Reinheimer</a> is semi-disposed of so we won't have the full settings of PHP yet, but depending on what's turned on, we could get some very interesting results.</p>

<p>I threw together a couple of variations of a solutions this afternoon and testing them out with <a href="http://pear.domain51.com/index.php?package=Domain51_MicroBench">Domain51_MicroBench</a>.  Seems <code>foreach</code> has had some tuning of how it handles temporary variables since the last time I benchmarked it.  I also found out how little PHP cares about whitespace.  I've got my current solution down to 130 bytes, with another 3 I could drop if they allow short tags.  </p>

<p>Of course, I could cut that by quite a few more depending on the config ;-)</p>
