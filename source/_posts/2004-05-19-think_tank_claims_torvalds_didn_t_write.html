title: Think Tank Claims Torvalds Didn't Write Linux
---
<p>
Wow!  Newsflash! Newsflash!  Linus didn't write Linux! 88| 88|  What next?!  OJ really did kill Nicole?</p>

<fieldset><legend>Quote</legend>Kenneth Brown, president of AdTI, claims that Linux is based on intellectual property "often taken or adapted without permission from material owned by other companies and individuals."</fieldset>

<p>
And Linus even goes on to admit it!</p>

<fieldset><p><legend>Linus Torvalds comes clean</legend></p>
<p>
"OK, I admit it. I was just a front man for the real fathers of Linux: the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. They (for obvious reasons) couldn't step forward to admit that they had gotten bitten by the computer bug and had been developing a series of operating systems on their own during the off-season.</p>

<p>
"But when they started with Linux (which they originally called Freax?they do feel like outsiders, you know, and that's a whole sad story in itself), they felt that they could no longer just let it languish in obscurity.</p>

<p>
"They started to look for a front man, and since Santa Claus is from Finland, and thus has connections to Helsinki University, and the Easter Bunny claimed, 'He's got good ears, if a bit small,' I got selected.</p>

<p>
"Since then, I've lived a life of subterfuge, always afraid that somebody would find out the truth. I'm actually relieved that it's over, and that the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution has finally uncovered the lie. I can now go back to my chosen profession, the exploration of the fascinating mating dance of the aquatic African frog."</p></fieldset>

<p>
How? Oh, how could you betray us like this?!</p>
