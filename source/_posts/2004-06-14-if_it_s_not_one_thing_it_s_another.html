<p>It seems like the last few weeks have been a series of calamities.  I've been fighting downed Internet connections, computer problems, server issues, and all last week I've had a heck of a sinus/allergy/cold-type thing.  This morning, I woke up feeling the best I have in a week, only to come in to work only to find that the <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr>, and thus my Internet was completely down.  We didn't get it working until about an hour ago, and that's about the time my body says it's time for lunch.  So after a quick sweat session at the Gate's on Main St (they apparently think an AC would hamper the "atmosphere"), I'm back.  I'm behind... but I'm back.</p>
