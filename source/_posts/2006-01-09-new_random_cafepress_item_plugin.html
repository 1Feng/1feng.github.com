title: New Random CafePress Item plugin
---
<p>The attentive eye will notice the new "From My Store" block in the sidebar.  I've created a plug-in for the Phoenix version <a href="http://b2evolution.net">b2evolution</a> that displays links to random CafePress items from any number of CafePress stores.  The code to handle the CafePress portion is based on <a href="http://php.amnuts.com/">Andrew Collington's</a> <a href="http://php.amnuts.com/index.php?do=view&amp;id=13">CafePress Box</a>.  I made a modification to make it work with <a href="http://store.travisswicegood.com/">my cpshop</a> CGI script instead of linking directly to CafePress so I can make things look more "branded".</p>

<p>Anyhow, the <a href="http://b2evolution.net/man/2004/09/26/writing_a_plugin_howto">new plugin system in Phoenix</a> is great.  There's still some undocumented features (like the SkinTag() method that I'm using), but once those get in place this will be a pretty useful system.  Now we just need a nice <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> for installing them and we're set.</p>

<p>As soon as I have a few more free moments to package this up, I'll add it to the <a href="http://plugins.b2evolution.net/">plugins</a> site.</p>
