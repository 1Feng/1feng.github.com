<p>So a quick recap of this past weekend - had way too much fun Friday night followed by even more fun Saturday and Sunday.  Spent both days out in the middle of nowhere at the <a href="http://www.epicrides.com/twofour/24.htm">24 Hours of Old Pueblo</a> (<a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/24hop-2005/">pictures here</a>) and got to hang out with a bunch of old <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/24hop-2005/IMG_2849.JPG.html">friends</a> and help their team out.  I didn't race as I could count the number of times I've been on a mountain bike this year on one hand.  A <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/03/20/p543">six hour race</a> might be an ok as a way to start the season off without any training, but a 24 is a totally different thing.</p>

<p>This weekend reminded me of something though: the reason I wanted to move back to the desert in the first place... <em>to ride and race</em>.  I haven't been doing nearly as much of that as I wanted or planned to, but now I'm going to make a conscious effort to start it up again.</p>

<p>Next up for me is <a href="http://www.dawntilduskrace.com/default.asp">Dawn 'til Dusk</a> in Gallup, NM.  As it stands now, I'll be doing a co-ed duo with a pretty <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/24hop-2005/IMG_2670.JPG.html">fast chick</a> (3 - or is it 4? - time women's sport champ for NM).  I'm figuring we can probably do pretty decent and I'm hoping to pull in at least 60% of the laps with her helping by giving me some recovery time every lap or two.</p>

<p>I'm headed up to Gallup this weekend for a preview of the course.  With any luck I'll have a couple of the locals showing me around so I make sure to see the actual course as opposed to just riding around for a few hours.</p>

<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/default.asp?rid=323371">Crank</a> declined to sponsor me again.  I'm actually thinking about picking up a jersey and seeing how many racing pictures I can get taken in it this year; then apply again next and just send them pictures. :-)</p>
