<p>Just got this email from <a href="http://www.usacycling.org/news/user/story.php?id=2225">USACycling</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Colorado Springs, Colo. (May 2, 2006)?Due to massive snowfall on Mammoth Mountain this winter, USA Cycling will be relocating its 2006 Mountain Bike National Championships scheduled for July 20-23.</p>

<p>?Looking at our snowpack today, I can confidently say we are unable to host a mountain bike event to the quality we are all accustomed to,? commented Bill Cockroft, senior vice president of operations at Mammoth Mountain. ?It was a difficult decision, but ultimately we believe we owe it to the mountain bike community to make sure the event continues at the level and standards expected by USA Cycling.?</p>

<p>USA Cycling is currently negotiating with several venues to replace Mammoth Mountain and a decision is expected to be announced shortly.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be too much to ask for this to happen at a lower altitude...  Unfortunately, I'm thinking this might mean it heads even further up.</p>

<p>My guesses are for the relocation are Durango, somewhere in Utah, or possibily Angelfire.  I don't think Angelfire has had a Nationals race before, but they do have a World Cup caliber setup as they did a WC race last year.  The only kicker, do they have a course capable of handling a marathon without getting people dizzy from going in circles?</p>
