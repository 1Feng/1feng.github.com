title: Drug panel has industry ties
---
<p>I heard this briefly this morning on NPR, but you'd think a story like <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N2526620.htm">this</a> would get a lot of media coverage.  This is a scandal in the making.  Where is the media?  Oh yeah, they're at the bank cashing the checks from the drug for all those commercial spots they've paid for.</p>

<blockquote><p>If those 10 members had not cast their votes, the committee would have voted 13-7 to recommend that Bextra be withdrawn and 14-8 that Vioxx should not return to the market.</p></blockquote>
