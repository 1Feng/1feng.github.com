title: AIM being funky...

<p>Is it just me, or does DSL not work as well as cable?  Yesterday I had a bunch of intermitent issues with my connection.  Up 3 minutes, down 5; up 10 minutes, down 3.  After it worked itself out I ended up having connection issues to AIM.  I can connect to Jabber, so if you need to get in touch with me via IM, use <em>me [at] 2 [dot] 0travis [dot] com</em>.</p>
