title: Second 6 hour race under my belt
---
<p>Well, I'm officially insane.  Yesterday I finished my second 6 hour race of the season up at Smithville's Smith Fork Trails.  The course was short, 3.5 miles, but brutal.  It was nearly all double-track, but there were a lot of really nasty transitions from descents to climbs.  There's one in particular that was 20+ <abbr title="mile per hour">mph</abbr> descent for  100 yards followed by a granny gear (by the end of the day) climb for 25 yards.  That constant up and down took its toll yesterday.</p>

<p>I didn't race the whole 6 hours.  I pulled out with about 30 minutes to go.  I was in 4th and thought the guy in 3rd had cracked and I would be able to over take him.  At five and a half hours, we were staying even.  Short of him having a mechanical and having to drop, there was no way I was going to pick up that last place so I pulled out.  I was two or three laps up on the guy in 5th and when all was said and done two or three laps out of 3rd.  When I pulled out, the guy in third was about 15 minutes in front of me.</p>

<p>My legs are doing remarkably well today.  The <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2005/03/20/what_i_learned_from_riding_my_bike_for_6">last race</a> was harder on me the day after for sure.  That's always a good sign as it means I'm starting to get my cycling strength back.  So far this year I think I've put in 20 hours on the bike, and over half of it has been in these last two races.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I spent the last hour and a half of the race in a perma-cramp that I was only able to push through with copious amounts of caffeine - which is a great pain-killer if you didn't already know it - and mental focus.  When  I saw it wasn't going to be possible to make up that last spot, though, my focus gave out and I couldn't keep going.  I knew I was in trouble when I had to start rolling the jumps in the course because my quads wouldn't take the punishment of landing.</p>

<p>The question invariably comes up.  Why do I put myself through something that borders on torture?  I guess because I can.  Yesterday, I road 49 miles in about five and a half hours.  There's a weird kind of pleasure I take from spending more time <strike>I</strike> <em>on</em> my bike in one afternoon than most people like to spend in a car.  Think about it.  When was the last time you spent 5 hours in a car?  </p>

<p>That's the same reason why people do a century on a road bike - there's a lot of people who rarely go 100 miles in a car at one time.  Imagine doing it on a bike.  Most people can't.  Of course, you have to be kinda crazy to enjoy this kind of "fun", but like I said... I'm officially insane :)</p>
