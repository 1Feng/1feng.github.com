title: "Javascript Framework Wars: A truce?"
---
<p>Not to be one to <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2007/02/15/javascript_framework_wars_or_why_can_t_w">just complain</a> and never offer solutions to the problems I raised, I decided to see if Mootools could be completely namespaced so it would play well with others.  And sure enough, <a href="http://forum.mootools.net/topic.php?id=1692&amp;replies=1">it can</a>.</p>

<p>Now we'll see if the guys over at <a href="http://mootools.net/">Mootools</a> are listening.</p>
