<p>Ugh!  This past week I was out hiking and commented several times "this is just too dry..." or "the forest is gonna close form a month..." or just shear screams of horror.  With all of this warm weather, the forests are going to be a tinderbox this late spring/early summer.  Sure enough, this past week we got our <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0313wildfire-ON.html">first taste</a> of things to come.</p>

<p>I hope I'm wrong.  Cycling becomes too expensive if you get caught poaching...  Hell, with the <a href="http://www.ridingthespine.com/Journey/uncategorized/denouement">recent examples being made of cyclists</a>, I might even end up with US Marshall's following me around the state, posing as independent magazine writers, and trying throw me in the pokey.</p>
