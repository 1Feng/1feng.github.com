My latest book on Git, [Pragmatic Guide to Git][pg_git] goes on sale today!
I'm really excited about this new book.  It's the culmination of a year's worth
of work on an entirely new format for [Pragmatic Bookshelf][pragprog].

From [today's announcement][newsletter]:

> Last summer, Pragmatic author Travis Swicegood proposed a new kind of book
> covering the popular version control system, Git. We thought it was a good
> idea--so much so that we’ve launched a whole new series in this format. Check
> out the details on the series below, as well as Travis’ new book, Pragmatic
> Guide to Git, now available [in beta][pg_git].

Having a good idea is cool.  Having a good idea that you can get other people
excited about too is even better.  I thought I was onto something interesting
when I pitched the idea to Prag, and so did everyone else there.  A year later
and here we are with an entire [new series][pg_series] lined up.

Here's the quick description of the new book:

> Need to learn how to wrap your head around Git, but don’t need a lot of hand
> holding? Grab this book if you’re new to Git, not to the world of
> programming. Git tasks displayed on two-page spreads provide all the context
> you need, without the extra fluff.
