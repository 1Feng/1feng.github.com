title: It's that time of qaudrennial

<p>The <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">presidential</a> campaigns are starting to kick in to gear.  <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">Barak Obama</a> announced yesterday and of what I've seen so far, he's my pick.  I wonder if he mountain bikes?  Anyhow...  </p>

<p>I was a little disappointed in his site, though.  I went there sure that he would have some "<em>Barak '08</em>" buttons to use on blogs to try to build up some grass roots support, but nope.  Nothing of the sort.  Clinton has a few, but most are huge and don't work well on blogs.</p>

<p>Upset at not being able to show my support in a geeky way, I decided to take matters in to my <a href="http://kalsey.com/tools/buttonmaker/">own hands</a> and here is the result:</p>
