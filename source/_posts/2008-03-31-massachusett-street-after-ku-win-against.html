<p>I've heard rumors that some of the bars are not going to be serving bottles of beer next weekend to keep the amount of sprayed beer to a minimum.   Unfortunately I wasn't partaking in the partying.  Next week though.  By then this cold should have run its course and I'll participate in the mob-making... :-)</p>
