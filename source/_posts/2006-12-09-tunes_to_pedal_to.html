<p>Wow...  <a href="http://soiledchamois.blogspot.com/index.html">Jason's</a> been putting out <a href="http://soiledchamois.blogspot.com/2006/12/keep-on-truckin.html">some</a> <a href="http://soiledchamois.blogspot.com/2006/12/my-little-donkey-deer-guts-and-trails.html">mixes</a> for riding.  I turned a couple of 'em on while I was out burning up <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/coconino/recreation/peaks/campbell-mesa-tr.shtml">Campbell Mesa</a>.  Wow... that music was perfect for today.  The trails were great too.  A little dry, but it's a week in to December and I was just out in a pair of thin tights and arm warmers - I'll take dry at 7,000 feet over nice and moist under a foot of snow any day!</p>
