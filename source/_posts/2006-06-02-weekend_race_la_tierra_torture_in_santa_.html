title: "Weekend race: La Tierra Torture in Santa Fe"
---
<p>Tomorrow I'm off to Santa Fe for <a href="http://www.sixhecklers.com/torture.html">La Tierra Torture</a>.  It's going to be a long haul over there and pack.  I'm figuring 7 hours each way.  Why do I do this again?  Oh yeah, because short of an S&amp;M club there's no where else I can pay money to publically inflict pain on myself along with a hundred of my closest friends. :D</p>

This is the first race in the <abbr title="New Mexico Off-Road Series".NMORS</abbr><p> that I'll be going in blind.  I've never ridden up there, but from the looks of the map looks like it should be a good course.  It appears that there's a mile or two of jeep roads, which the 29'er will love.</p>

<p>I was hoping to have my new <a href="https://www.wingnutgear.com/product_details.cfm?id=117">Wingnut Hyper 2.5</a> in for the race so I could try it in a race before the two national events come up in July.  Unless it comes today, that's not going to happen.  I should have it by the Watermelon Classic, but a week and a half later I'll be in Utah so there won't be much dial-in time at races.  Hmm...  I know a couple of you that read this have Wingnuts - does it normally take over a week to get them?</p>

This week's been kind of slow.  My legs/body haven't fully recovered from last weekend's debauchery plus helping some friends move on Tuesday from their second story appartment.  I remember why I made such a big deal about having a ground level one now.  I've been taking it easy on the bike this week with only one semi-hard day of climbing.  Hopefully, that'll have me well rested for Santa Fe.  Now if I could only figure out how to not have to sit in a car for 7 hours tomorrow I'd be golden.</abbr>
