title: Declaration of Revocation

<p><a href="http://www.stephaniemiller.com/declarationofrevocation.htm">This</a> is really good...</p>

<blockquote><p>To the citizens of the United States of America, in the light of your failure to elect a competent President of the USA and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective today.</p>

<p>Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths and other territories.</p>

<p>Except Utah, which she does not fancy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Brilliant.  The page I've linked to says it's the work of <a href="http://www.thejohncleese.com/">John Cleese</a> - but I can't find anything to back that up.  You would think he would have a link to it <a href="http://www.thejohncleese.com/">his site</a>, but nada.  There was nothing mentioned about it in the forums either, which makes me think it's probably just an anonymous writer trying to gain credibility via someone else's name.  <a href="http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/d/declarationrevocation.htm">Truth or Fiction</a> wasn't able to find any origin for the piece either.</p>

<p>Regardless of who wrote it, it's hilarious.  Especially if you think of it being delivered as a monologue by Cleese.</p>
