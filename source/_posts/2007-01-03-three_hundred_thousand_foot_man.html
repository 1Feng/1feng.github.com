title: Three hundred thousand foot man
---
<p>Last year I managed to barely squeak past <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/01/02/one_hundred_thousand_foot_man">100, 000 vertical feet</a>.  Actually, the numbers were pretty small but I was pleased consider there were whole months that I hardly rode at all.  Well, I finally got the numbers tallied for 2006, so without any further adieu.</p>

<table><tr><th></th><th>Total Rides</th><th>Time (hours</th><th>Miles</th><th>Feet Climbed</th></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Mountain Bike</th><td>70</td><td>153.36</td><td>1299.5</td><td>173978.7</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Road Bike Rides</th><td>88</td><td>95.46</td><td>1531.82</td><td>138789</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">Totals</th><td>158</td><td>248.82</td><td>2831.32</td><td>312767.7</td></tr>
</table>

<p>I averaged 3.04 rides per week, spending 4.79 hours per week on the bike, and averaged 54.45 miles per week.  Compared to <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/01/02/one_hundred_thousand_foot_man#c4721">last year</a>, I trippled my hours in the saddle, more than doubled my miles.  I'd have to dig out my data from last year, but I don't think I even broke 100 rides last year, so I know I got in more there.</p>

<p>I need to work on early season burnout.  I raced way too much in the early season this past year.  By August I was ready to quit looking at my bike.  Definitely on my "needs work" list for 2007.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've got some major climbing right out my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2006/11/29/it_s_cold_outside">back door</a> now, though, so I'm thinking my first half million foot year might just been 2007 :-)  Keep an eye on <a href="http://tswicegood.motionbased.com">my MB site</a> for the data.</p>
