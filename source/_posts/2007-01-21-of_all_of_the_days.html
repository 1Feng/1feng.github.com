title: Of all of the days...
---
<p>... that it rains in Phoenix - all 36 of them a year (and that includes a 30 minute sprinkle) - I pick the day that it rains <strike>really</strike> nearly all day to go down and pre-ride a race course.  3 hours in the car playing slip 'n' slide on ice through the mountains, and I don't even get to ride.</p>
