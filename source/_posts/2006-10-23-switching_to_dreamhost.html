title: Switching to Dreamhost
---
<p>I'm in the process of switching the majority of my hosting over to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?238969">Dreamhost</a>.  There might be some outages on some of my sites while I go through this process, so I'm apologizing up front.</p>

<p>A shameless plus, cause I get some money from them too, but if you're looking for a good budget host with a lot of features, I'd definitely <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?238969">recommend them</a>.  If you sign up, be sure to put "<em>TRAVIS50OFF</em>" as the offer code and it'll give you $50 off of whatever hosting you sign up for.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I forgot to mention the coolest part, they offer Jabber servers as part of any of their packages too, so I have a new Jabber (i.e. Google Talk) account: <em>me [at] 2 [dot] 0travis [dot] com</em>.</p>
