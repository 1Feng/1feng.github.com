title: Fedora Core 2 Installation
---
<p>
You know the calm before the storm... how everything seems ereily right.  I'm experiencing that right now.  I just installed <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Core 2</a>, and it went to smoothly...  When is my hard drive going to fail or my CD burner going to start throwing stuff at me?  What's wrong with my computer?!</p>
