title: Sometimes the cards are just stacked against you...

<p>And tonight, they seemed to be that way.  At the weekly poker tournament at friend's house, I played pretty well.  Lost two hands where I bet heavy on three of a kind only to loose to a full house and a straight - both times to the same guy who's known for bluffing.  I think I called the two hands he really made.</p>

<p>After a re-buy about an hour into the night, I managed to make it to the final table and got into a heads-up match around 12:30.  An hour later, we're both still at it going back and forth with the winner taking home $150, the looser taking home $20.  After several all-ins, most of which worked, some didn't, we're at almost even.  I've got Ace 9, and the flop is a 9 high bunch of trash.  I've got the best hand out, short of her having  a pocket pair.  Based on the way she's betting the hand, she doesn't have it.  I go all in, she calls.  She's Ace 4 - she has nothing on the board but Ace high.  I've got it, and the chip lead...</p>

<p>Until she draws two fours.</p>

<p>To quote  the dealer - a shock wave came out of that second four as it flipped over.</p>
