title: Ken Brill's Mashing SugarCRM Presentation Notes
---
<p>Ken is one of our open-source hires.  He contributed to our forums then came on board.</p>

<ul><li>He's a self-styled programming layman</li>
<li>What is Web 33 1/3? :-)</li>
<li>Some links to web APIs for mashups: <a href="http://www.webmashup.com">http://www.webmashup.com</a></li>
and <a href="http://techmagazine.ws /full-web-20-api-list">http://techmagazine.ws /full-web-20-api-list</a>.
<li>Ken is demonstrating Google docs inside of SugarCRM.  That's actually an awesome use of it.</li>
<li>One of his older hacks was using Y! getting local time based on where the client was.</li>
<li>Next up is bringing Google Gadgets to the SugarCRM Dashlets</li>
<li>Some of the more useful ones he mentioned are "Hotjobs so you can look for your new job while you screw around on your current one..."  "Britney Watch"</li>
<li>He's not a fan of Dr. Pepper Cherry Chocolate - "my god that's a horrible mashup"</li>
<li>"ModuleBuilder is the best thing that happened to Sugar in my opinion."</li>
<li>side note: Ken's St. Louis accent is coming through with his "alls I had to do" :-)</li>
<li>note to self: double check any syntax highlighting before giving a presentation.  Zend Studio's lime green highlight doesn't come through the screen that well.</li>
<li>note to self: Get Ken running APC or Zend Platform ;-)</li>
<li>His Google Doc presentation is pretty spiffy.  I was hoping for an embedded Google Doc inside SugarCRM, it currently just gives you a list view which is useful by itself, but if it was inside Sugar it would be even cooler.</li>
<li>He used the Zend Framework/Google Doc examples to actually interface with Google Docs.</li>
<li>Second up was a Google Gadget mashup.  It was extremely straight forward, just pull in the &lt;script&gt; value inside a set of {literal} tags in the Smarty template for a dashlet.  </li>
<li>note to SugarCon guys: The presentation could have been cool as a <abbr title="Bring Your Own Laptop">BYOL</abbr> presentation and actually created one or two mashups on the fly</li></ul>
