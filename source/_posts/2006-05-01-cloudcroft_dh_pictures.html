title: Cloudcroft DH pictures
---
<p>I hung around for the downhill race yesterday and shot some pictures.  As it turned out, the <a href="http://photos.travisswicegood.com/v/cycling-photos/2006-high-altitude-dh/">two coolest shots</a> of the day both came from a buddy I used to ride with in El Paso and super cool guy, Jamie of <a href="http://www.roughriderracing.org/">Rough Rider Racing/Canyon</a>.  It's nice when it works out like that.</p>

<p>I haven't got all the pictures online yet, but will try.  I had a few requests for photos from the DH event, leave me a comment with the racer #s and I'll be sure to get you a copy of them.</p>
