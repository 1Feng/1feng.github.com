<p>Nope.  This cold won't give up.  I did sleep the night through and woke up with some semblance of breathing through my nose this morning, but I'm still hacking gunk up and my chest has a feeling like someone's pushing on it from the congestion.  This hasn't moved to an infection yet so there's nothing to do but keep downing shots of Dayquil to help ease the symptoms and relax as much as possible.</p>

<p>So much for a long weekend being relaxing... :-/</p>
