title: Talk about feeling blah...
---
<p>Today's just been weird for me.  I don't hardly want to look at a computer for some reason and I've got no clue why.  I'm thinking it's a vitamin/mineral deficiency of some sort...  Got to remember to take vitamins after a weekend of riding like I did this past one.</p>

<p>Anyhow, in my blahs today I got to thinking about what makes a pro mountain biker a pro mountain biker.  Is it the confidence to quit their job, move to the mountains, and try to scrap out a living while they ride?  Is it all genetics; predetermined before we role up to the line?  Is it just the opportunity to?  Or is it just raw want to?  Day's like today (low 80s) make we wish that all I had to do was get up and hop on the bike for 4 or 5 hours or longer and just ride.  So what do you have to do to get there?  What do <em>I</em> have to do to get there?</p>

<p>Man, it's only been two weeks since my last race and I'm feeling withdraws.  I can't wait for <a href="http://www.highaltitude.org/">Cloudcroft</a> this weekend.</p>
