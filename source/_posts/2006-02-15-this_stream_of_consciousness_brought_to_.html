<p>I should know better than drunk typing, but...  So you can't say you weren't forewarned.</p>

<p>I've been making some guest appearances on another <a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/">website</a> for the last few days.  I choose a friend's site to come out about my <a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/?p=244">cross dressing ways</a>.  It just felt more comfortable that way, unlike the pearl thong I was wearing that day.  They're fun to play with, but just not that practical for long term wear.</p>

<p>Seriously though, do you ever feel like you're being ganged up on?  I seem to attract this odd following of female bloggers who love to pick on me.  In KC it was the <a href="http://superficialplazachick.blogspot.com/">Superfical Plaza Chick</a>, and now that I've moved out here I've moved on from monogamous "being-picked-on" relationships to swinging relationship where everybody is taking there shot tag team style...  In no particular order:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://mhoover.blogspot.com/2006/02/little-story.html"> A Little Story.... Called....Travis is mean.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mhoover.blogspot.com/2006/02/its-good-thing.html">I have questionable taste</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/?p=240">I'm a cross dresser</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/?p=244">I'm hijacking blogs and posting in the future</a>: I might hang out late, but I've never gone home from Christine and Charles' at 1:30 PM on Saturday from the previous night's poker game.</li></ul>

<p>And the topper - I tagged <a href="http://www.planetcrimson.com/">Planet Crimson</a> with a "Travis was here" (which in all fairness, I really think I would have been more creative), and I have had a <a href="http://mhoover.blogspot.com/">blogged dedicated</a> (at least parenthetically - a gold star for me, I spelled it right the first time and I'm drunk) to "picking on [me]".</p>

<p>Oh I feel the love... much like a celebrity does when they're being stalked.</p>
