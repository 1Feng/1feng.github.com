title: So be it?
---
<p>I got an email this afternoon from a friend who sends out a bunch of forwards at least once a week.  Most of them are pretty funny, some are kind of crude, but a lot of 'em bring a smile to my face.  This one hit a note though:</p>

<fieldset><p><legend>Quote from email</legend>There is a recent poll that says, 9 out of 10 Americans believe "Under God" belongs<br />
in our Pledge of Allegiance. <br />
Should the 9 people be forced to suppress their beliefs for the 1 who don't believe? </p>

<p>Why don't we just tell the 1 person to Sit Down and SHUT UP!!! </p>

<p>If you agree, pass this on, if not simply delete.</p></fieldset>

<p>If pollsters would have asked Mississippians if blacks and whites should be in the same schools 50 years ago, I think 9 out of 10 respondents would have said that shouldn't happen.</p>

<p>If pollsters would have asked men if women should have voting rights 90 years ago, 9 out of 10 would have said no.</p>

<p>If pollsters would have asked southern's if slaves should be treated as property or human beings  150 years ago, 9 out of 10 would have said property.</p>

<p>You see, the facts pollster give you can be wrong.  The data they have collected is not in error, it is that the frame of mind of the folks they're polling which is.  I'm not saying we shouldn't include "under God" in the pledge, but let us remember that "under God" isn't a tradition from the founding of our nation or any other such momentous event, unless something happened in 1954 that I don't know about.</p>
