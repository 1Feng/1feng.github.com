title: The media doesn't get it
---
<p>I just came across what started as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/arts/05rich.html?oref=login&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position=">good article</a> by Frank Rich at NYTimes.com.  The idea is that Brain Williams is not an anchorman out for a story, but out for an audience.  I agree - nearly all TV news is done that way.  "It's the [ratings], stupid."</p>

<p>But then Rich just showed his general contempt for all things not ordained by the almighty Times - he turned his wrath toward blogs.  Bloggers are apparently right-wing, wannabe pundints with so few journalism skills as to make a monkey with a typewriter a more fair, balanced reporter.</p>

<p>I have to chuckle at this guys seeming oblivion to the rest of the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>And so network news still counts. The idea, largely but not exclusively fomented by the right, that TV news might somehow soon be supplanted by blogging as a mass medium may remain a populist fantasy until Americans are able to receive blogs by iPod. (At which point they become talk radio.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Hey Franky boy, it's call <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=podcasting">podcasting</a>. If I realy wanted to rub his face in exactly how out of touch he really is, I'd mention something about Googling his <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Frank%20Rich%22">all-important name</a> and the results versus Googling <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=podcasting">podcasting</a>, but I don't want to be that mean.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/hill/daily-briefing-run-for-four-years-026719.php">Wonkette</a> for turning me on to the story.</em></p>
