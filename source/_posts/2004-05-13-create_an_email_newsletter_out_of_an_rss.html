title: Create an email newsletter out of an RSS feed
---
<p>
Seems simple enough, phpList is supposed to support creating an email newsletter from an RSS feed straight out of the box.  Well that's what they say.  I've fiddled with it for a good 30 minutes (after I had it setup and running).  I just can't get it to send a message from my RSS feed.  I'm kind of disappointed as I was hoping to offer RSS feeds via email for folks who don't have or wouldn't know how to setup a feed reader.  Oh well...</p>
