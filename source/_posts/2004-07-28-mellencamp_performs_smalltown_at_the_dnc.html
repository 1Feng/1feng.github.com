title: Mellencamp performs Smalltown at the DNC convention
---
<p>Just saw <a href="http://www.mellencamp.com">John Mellencamp</a> perform <a href="http://www.mellencamp.com/albums/scarecrow/index.html">Small Town</a>.  Google doesn't back me up on this, but my memory is telling me that he denied a Republican, it would seem the first Bush, the right to use that as their campaign's theme song.  Interesting that he shows up playing it live now...</p>
