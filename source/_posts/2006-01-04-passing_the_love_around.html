<p>So if you've got some holiday money burning a whole in your pocket, you can spend it at my <a href="http://store.travisswicegood.com/">store</a>.  I've had it up for ages, just haven't pushed it.  All kinds of fun stuff :-)</p>

<p>While you're there, you can use the coupon code <em>BEARERMETHOD</em> to get $5 off your order.  The code is good for all <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/storeref.aspx?refby=travisswicegood">CafePress</a> orders... but you only want to order my stuff, right? :-)</p>
