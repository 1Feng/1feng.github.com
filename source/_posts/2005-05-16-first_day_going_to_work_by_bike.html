title: First day going to work by bike
---
<p>Well - today was productive for me.  Got a lot of work done, finished up the first stage of a really cool creek crossing at the <a href="http://www.earthriders.com/trails/trail.php?s=mo&amp;file=smithville.xml">Smithville Trails</a> in and managed to commute to work via bike today.  Got a little over an hour and a half in on the bike.  It's the first time I've ridden my bike in to work in nearly two years, and it felt great.  This week is the <a href="http://www.marc.org/bcc/">Bicycle Commmuter Challenge</a> and I'm participating.  I don't think I'm going to get to ride every day, but I'll be getting in at least three days.  I generally spend 50 - 60 minutes a day in my car driving back and forth, so for only 40 minutes more I get to ride my bike.  A great trade-off because it should help me get my racing legs back under me.</p>
