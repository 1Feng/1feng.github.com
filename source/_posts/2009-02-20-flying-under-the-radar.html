title: Flying under the radar
---
<p>Yeah, I know it's been way too long.  This isn't a real post.  Sorry for getting your hopes up.</p>

<p>I'm just saying that I've been flying under the radar (as the number of <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">tweets</a> show), but that'll be changing before too long.  I have a huge backlog of things I've been meaning to blog about so that should keep everyone happy for awhile.</p>
