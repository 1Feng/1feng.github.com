<p>Keep your fingers crossed.  I'm hoping to hear from <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/">Crank Sports</a> within the next week or so with good news.  I've applied for team-sponsorship this year, and I'm hoping they'll come through with something.  Even if they don't, I'll still be using their <a href="http://www.cranksports.com/products/">products</a>.  They have some of the best stuff on the market, in my opinion, but it would be cool to have that Crank jersey to help evangelize at the races.</p>
