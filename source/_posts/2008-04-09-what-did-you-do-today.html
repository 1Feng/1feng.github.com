title: What did you do today?
---
<p>Either I'm making up for time I spent slacking, or I just took 4 years off of my life today.  Today I managed to:</p>

<ul><li>Have my <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/git+book;">git book</a> from Pragmatic Bookshelf announced: <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tsgit">Pragmatic Version Control Using Git</a> - It'll be on a shelf near you this fall and in PDF form before then.</li>
<li>I filed my taxes (not completely today - I'd already done then, just hadn't submitted them yet)</li>
<li>Proved conclusively that an installation stack wasn't stable for production (which is always fun when it's a random failure and you're having to play by the Law of Large Numbers)</li>
<li>Proved conclusively that another stack was stable</li>
<li>Should be able to prove or disprove a third stack configuration by the end of the night</li>
<li>Got <a href="http://phpt.info">PHPT</a> setup for inclusion into PHP as a replacement for the run-tests.php code which means it'll be distributed as part of the core PHP product</li>
<li>Got PHPT onto the Google Summer of Code project list for the upcoming summer (as part of it becoming part of php-src)</li>
<li>Fleshed out a killer business idea with a buddy of mine</li>
<li>Wrote what I think was a pretty good <a href="http://www.travisswicegood.com/index.php/2008/04/09/the-future-of-relational-database-manage">article on relational databases</a></li>
<li>Spent an hour at the gym this morning doing a lower-body workout</li></ul>

<p>And it's just now 5. ;-)</p>
