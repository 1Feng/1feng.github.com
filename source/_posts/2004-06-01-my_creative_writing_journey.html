title: My creative writing journey
---
<p>One of the original aims of my starting a blog last fall was to better my writing abilities.  <a href="http://www.fromthecrossroads.ws/">From the Crossroads</a> transformed from a personal site into a business site, so I left my thoughts for more creative writing and adopted a more professional approach toward what I presented.  I've tried to stay on topic, and offer insights that will help those looking for <em>new media ideas</em> and plain English explanations of the Internet.  Hopefully, I've succeeded in some small part.</p>

<p>But this is <em>my</em> site.  It's just about me, and the various pursuits I make.  One thing I am going to attempt to do is better my writing.  This afternoon I received my monthly writer's prompts from <a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/">Writer's Digest</a>, so I have a full 30 ideas for various pieces things to write about.  Now I'm not going to promise a full 30 different creative pieces, but I'm going to see how many I can come up with.  I should be able to handle 10... We'll see.</p>
