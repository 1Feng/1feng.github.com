title: "Polyphasic Sleep: Night 1"
---
<p>Despite <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/cda/article.do?site=MensHealth&amp;channel=health&amp;category=other.diseases.ailments&amp;conitem=f5802c4d88ee9110VgnVCM10000013281eac____&amp;page=0&amp;print=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.menshealth.com%2Fcda%2Farticle.do%3Fsite%3DMensHealth%26channel%3Dhealth%26category%3Dother.diseases.ailments%26conitem%3Df5802c4d88ee9110VgnVCM10000013281eac____%26page%3D0">dire warnings</a>, I've decided to give polyphasic sleep a try.  This week is pretty routine for me on the work front, so I think I can get away with it.</p>

<p>I have a simple reason for this experiment: curiosity.  I can think of all sorts of things I would like to be able to do if time weren't an issue, and picking up an extra 40 hours week seems like a good trade off.  In the end, I might not be able to keep it up just because of social strain it creates.  Since I don't have an office to go in to or very many particular schedules to worry about keeping, it seems like I should be able to handle the social part of it though.</p>

<p>I'll be sure to blog about anything interesting I discover, and of course I'll be <a href="http://twitter.com/tswicegood">twittering</a> about it.  Now, maybe I can start making a dent in the ever-growing todo list that I have.</p>
