title: Win key is back from vacation
---
<p>
While writing that last post it dawned on me that mabye I should check out the Fedora bug page.  Now that it has been out a few days, maybe someone's found out what caused the problem.  And sure enough, there it was.  Just needed one modification - which I posted - and I have my Win key back.</p>

Ahh... the many joys of leading edge.</p>
